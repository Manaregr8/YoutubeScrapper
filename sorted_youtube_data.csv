About Buckshot Roulette:

BUCKSHOT ROULETTE is a tabletop horror game that attempts to re-design the infamous game of Roulette, replacing the traditional revolver with a proper 12-gauge pump-action shotgun. This extra firepower, and more importantly the different mechanics in handling a shotgun compared to a revolver, offers a fresh take on the classic game of chance.

The game takes place at the top of an underground club, where the metal railings tremble to the pulse of long lost drum machines. A crooked AI dealer is waiting for you. Will you meet them?","IGP","buckshot roulette, buckshot roulette double or nothing, buckshot roulette update, buckshot roulette double or nothing 250000, buckshot roulette biggest earnings, buckshot roulette highest earnings, buckshot roulette double or nothing ending, buckshot roulette game, buckshot roulette gameplay, buckshot roulette ending, buckshot roulette review, buckshot roulette trailer, buckshot roulette horror game, buckshot roulette igp, igp, buckshot roulette gameplay igp, horror games","20","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action-adventure_game, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_culture","2024-01-17T16:11:39Z","PT30S","27701658","4784",false,,""

Ludo King is a friends and family game that was once played by kings and now it can be enjoyed by you and your family and friends. You'll be playing this Ludo for hours and its fun for the whole family.

Ludo King is a perfect time pass game of Ludo board game. You played Ludo in your childhood, now play on your phone and tablet.

Another nostalgic game similar in structure is Snakes and Ladders. Like Ludo, you may have played this board game when you were young. Ludo King now incorporates this classic game as a whole new level. The objective of the game is simple: you start on 1 and you have to be the first one to make it to 100. However, you can only move the same number of tiles as the number you roll on a die. If you land on the same tile as the beginning of a ladder, then you can take the ladder as a shortcut and move on up. A game of ups and down, Snakes and Ladders has been a favorite for generations; and now you can play it too, with Ludo King. 

Ludo has different names in different regions and countries like Fia, Fia-spel (Fia the game), Le Jeu de Dada (The Game of Dada), Non t'arrabbiare, Fia med knuff (Fia with push), C·ªù c√° ng·ª±a, Uckers, Griniaris, Petits Chevaux (Little Horses), Ki nevet a v√©g√©n, ÿ®ÿ±ÿ≥Ÿä (Barjis/Barjees). People also misspell Ludo as Loodo, Chakka, Lido, Lado, Ledo, Leedo, Laado, or Lodo.

Offroad Outlaws gives you what you want in an off-road game: Complete control over how you build, setup, and drive your rig, tons of challenges to complete, and multiplayer so you can explore the trails on the open-world maps with your friends.

CONTROL
You build your rig the way you want it. You have total control over chassis setup - stiffness, damping, travel, etc... and can even swap to a different type of suspension if you want (want a modern truck with an I-Beam setup in front, and a solid axle in back? No problem.) For vehicle control, you're given Tilt, Arrow, or on-screen Steering wheel controls. You choose!

DRIVE
With several open world maps to choose from you can drive your rig slow across challenging rock routes, or fast over the flat sands of the desert. Want to take a break from the trails? Go play in the stunt park where you can use the ramps to ""test"" your rig's durability, or test your drivings skills in the Rock Park.

Hello everyone who has visited my channel! I would like to share with you how I captured this gameplay and why it stands out. The first step involves selecting the game I want to capture. Usually, I choose games that I personally enjoy and feel confident in. Once I have made my selection, I begin recording the gameplay. After the recording is complete, I proceed to edit the footage. I utilize the Cap Cut program to produce my own distinct content. This involves incorporating different effects, adjusting the video's speed, adding sound effects, and more. I strive to make my videos captivating and enjoyable, so that viewers cannot take their eyes off the screen. Finally, I include closing screensavers and upload the video to my YouTube channel. Through this process, I capture gameplay and generate my own one-of-a-kind content. I put forth my efforts with love and a deep passion for games, ensuring that my viewers only experience the best impressions.

Over the past couple of decades, India has emerged as a burgeoning hub for video game development, contributing to the global gaming landscape with a unique blend of creativity and technical expertise.

With the industry's roots firmly planted in the early 2000s, studios such as Dhruva Interactive, Ubisoft Pune, and Indiagames played pivotal roles in shaping the trajectory of Indian game development.

As technology advanced and the market expanded, a new generation of independent game developers and studios emerged, crafting games that reflected not only India's rich cultural tapestry but also showcased the nation's prowess in innovation and storytelling.

Titles like ""Raji: An Ancient Epic"" and ""Asura"" exemplify the diverse narratives and artistic styles that Indian game developers bring to the table. As the industry continues to grow, supported by a rising number of skilled professionals and a global audience hungry for fresh perspectives, India stands poised to make increasingly significant contributions to the ever-evolving world of video games.

Everyone is finished except you.
Are you gonna try to cross the line?

Go ahead and take her away.
I just eliminated my daughter.
And these challenges are
gonna get even harder.
Congratulations, everyone here.
You are moving on to the next round.
Round
Red light,
green light is the easiest challenge,
and we already eliminated
four contestants.
Contestants, please stand on your number.
The game you will be
playing is Squid says.
If squid doesn't say
to do it and you do it,
you will be eliminated.
Squid says put your arms up in the air.
Squid says put your arms out to the side.
Put your arms
down.
Squid didn't say, put your hands down.
I have to eliminate you.
Take them out.
Squid says put your arms down.
Squid says
say, I'm Sigma.
I'm Sigma.
Squid says turn to the right.
Number five, turn to the left.
I'm sorry.
All right, you did a full circle.
You didn't just turn to your right.
Okay,
I'm sorry.
Squid says point to
someone that scares you.
7.
You're pointing to 18.
Is it because he's the oldest guy in here?
18.
You are pointing to 17.
I feel like he's my only competition.
You're pointing at number nine.
Number nine was talking trash earlier.
Well, who are you pointing to?
Oh, back in.
Okay, you two.
11 and 16 are pointing to you.
Why do you think they're scared of you?
Cause I'm taller.
Number nine, your brother.
Why does he scare you?
Because he won the Roblox,
so I think he's pretty tough.
Competitors.
Squid says put your arms down.
Squid says say,
I'm moving on to the next round.
I'm moving on to the next round.
Congratulations, everyone here.
But if you want to win
that thousand dollars,
it is going to get a lot harder.
We've already eliminated six,
which means we are down to our final 12.
But only one will win the thousand
dollars before we find out
what the next challenge is.
I need you guys to do subscribe.
We're trying to hit 18 million
by the end of the year.
So join the zam fam.
And now
let's bring in the contestants.
Have a seat in front of a popsicle stick.
Now that you are all sitting down,
this is a game of duck,
duck,
goose.
If you are the goose,
you must tag someone and sprint
around and get to their spot
without them tagging you.
If they tag you, you go in the mush pot.
If they don't tag you,
they go in the mush pot.
Whoever is in the mush pot at
the end is up for elimination.
Everyone grab your stick.
What does yours say?
Duck, Duck, Duck.
Duck.
Duck.
Duck.
Goose.
It looks like number eight
is starting off as our goose.
Go ahead.
Duck, duck, duck, Duck, Duck.
Goose.
Oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh.
Number 16.
I did not tag number eight,
which means she goes in the mush pot.
Number six.
Now you get to choose
someone to be the goose.
Which number do you want to choose?
Three, two, one.
I'm really bad at duck, duck, goose.
I hope I don't get picked.
You're gonna go whet me McQueen on you.
Number 10.
You get to choose someone to be a goose.
Remember,
who you choose could also
end up in this mush pot.
Who are you gonna choose?
Number 11.
Okay, number 11.
Duck,
duck,
duck, duck, goose.
Oh, man.
This is it.
Number...
seven.
You tagged her,
which means 11 is in the mush pot.
I was not expecting her to be that fast.
I knew I was gonna catch her.
All of you are up for elimination.
But we will let the remaining
contestants decide who that person is.
You have one minute to discuss.
Guys,
I think we get the highest number
because they posed the biggest threat.
No, I think
number six.
Number six.
Guys, not on number 11.
Just raise your hand for number 11.
I have no idea which one
they are gonna choose,
but one of them is going to be eliminated.
Raise your hand for number six.
And
time.
Who have you chosen?
Number six.
Okay, I'm sorry.
Number six.
They got me out, but I'll be back.
The youngest player left in
this game just got eliminated.
I was not expecting that.
Thank you, guys for not voting for me.
But why didn't you?
I'm the oldest.
Would have been the smartest move...
I did.
Congratulations.
Everyone here is moving
on to the next round.
For this challenge,
we're gonna find out who the leaders
are and how well they work with a team.
Come on in.
You're right, clo.
In case you can't tell
this game is Battleship.
Now,
if you have an even number,
I want you to stand over here.
If you have an odd number, stand here.
Now that you guys are lit up,
these are your teams.
You will need to pick a team.
Captain, you have one minute to discuss.
I don't know.
I think it's between you
and you.
I vote 15.
I vote 15 as well.
I chose number 15 as captain
because she said she had a lot
of experience in Battleship.
17 seems to be looking out for me.
I think he's the right one to trust.
Everyone come forward.
Even team, who is Your captain?
Number 18.
With him as our captain,
I think our team's gonna win.
He better not lose this.
They picked me as captain,
but the only person I'm
looking out for is me.
And odd team, who is your captain?
Number 15.
15.
We were gonna pick 17,
but he had never played.
So we picked the second oldest.
I'm really shy.
I don't know why they
picked me as captain.
The way this challenge works
is the captain will place your
boats and make the calls.
The first boat that sinks gets eliminated.
Guards, bring forward the boats.
Go ahead
and place your boat.
I think we should move that one.
Because if they get the big one,
they're gonna have no
idea there's another.
One next to it.
It looks like both are trying
to cause a distraction,
but let's see if the
other team falls for it.
And
time.
Wherever you are at,
you must stay on your ship.
It looks like the team captain on
this side chose the one person boat,
which means if he gets out,
he sacrificed himself.
Feel nervous?
Our captain made great decisions.
I'm not nervous at all.
Let the Battleship game begin.
Even,
since you have more people,
you get to go first.
Make your first pick.
We're gonna take B4.
Let's see if that's a hit or a miss.
That is a myth.
Odd captain, it's your turn.
That is A.
I can't believe they already
found one of our ships.
18.
The choice you make could determine
whether or not you are one
step closer to winning $1,000.
What is your next play?
There.
So far, the Evens have got
no ships yet.
Let's see if the odds can take them out.
What is your next play?
That is a hit.
You have another hit,
but no ship has gone down yet.
Evens, it's your play.
I'm so happy we hit one of theirs.
I was so nervous when
they picked 15 square.
I was right below her.
Evens are back in the game.
At this point, anyone can win Battleship.
15.
You have two hits,
which means there's a three
person boat somewhere.
You could go either way.
Do you know which way you're gonna go?
Yes.
If they choose a four,
our captain is gone.
D4.
D4.
Are you sure?
This could be the difference
between winning or losing $1,000?
Yeah, I'm sure.
D4
is a
hit.
D4
was a hit
and a sink,
which means the odds win Battleship.
I'm proud of 15.
She really stepped up.
I can't believe this.
Unfortunately,
you three were on the boat that got sank,
which means
all three of you are eliminated.
No, no high back, no high five.
You just got three of
your teammates eliminated.
How do you feel?
Not great.
But it wasn't my square.
So our captain was selfish.
He didn't even care.
We lost three people.
18's reaction after the other
boat sank instead of his shows.
He's playing for himself.
It's not my fault.
They're the ones who chose me as captain.
If you had picked the other way,
you would have gotten out 18.
Now though, everyone
is moving on to the next round.
So head to the tunnel.
This is getting crazier.
And the competitiveness in each of
these players is definitely show.
They're not gonna like
this next challenge.
We all know in squid game you
need a little bit of luck.
So let's see how they do.
Bring in the contestant.
Come on over
it turn on.
In here is a ball with your number on it.
Please go ahead and grab it.
Now that you have your number,
we're gonna play a game
called odd or even.
Two of you will go at a time and
you'll have to guess if I'm
gonna roll an odd or an even.
If you are wrong,
you will place your ball into here.
Let's start with the lowest...
highest number.
Seven and 18, please step forward.
Do you think I'm going to roll?
And odd or even?
Step into the square you
think is going to be right.
Oh, looks like he both chose different.
Let's see who is right.
Oh, yeah.
Even
your wrong.
Your ball
is going in here.
17...
and 8, please step forward.
Do you want to choose odd like
him or do you want to do even?
We're going down together.
I rolled a three,
which is odd,
which means both of you are right.
You get to keep your ball
and get back in line.
Fifteen
and nine, please step forward.
Odd are an even number two,
you're both doing odd.
Let's see.
five
is odd,
which means both of you get to
keep your numbers 11 and 14,
please step forward.
You both are going even.
Let's see.
I rolled a three,
which means you guys are wrong.
Everyone
that's still has their number,
please step forward.
You now need to decide am
I gonna roll odd or even?
I usually always pick odd.
It's my lucky side.
You are putting $1,000 potentially
on the line for an even.
I'm confident.
You guys are feeling confident with odds.
Let's see.
What I rol.
Even
is right.
I rolled a six,
which means all of you,
please put your numbers in here.
Guess I'm not so lucky today.
Only one of you
will win this.
The other has the potential to
be eliminated like everyone else.
So I'm about to roll.
Do you think it'll be even or odd?
They're both choosing the same.
You both could be out,
and you both could lose.
Are you changing
I was standing on odd,
but my gut was just telling me to go even.
You said evens were your lucky number.
Only one of you is going to win this.
The other will put
their number into
even.
Won.
Number eight is putting
her ball into the mix.
Number seven,
please step to the side as you are safe.
Everyone here is up for elimination
except for number seven,
who won that game.
So I will be picking three numbers and
those three numbers will be eliminated.
Sign in.
I'm praying she doesn't pick my number.
It's right next to her hand.
Eleven,
you are eliminated.
And then there are two.
Just like that,
your chance at $1,000 will be over.
Nine.
Nine, you are eliminated.
And the final number being eliminated is.
Rebecca's hand is right
by my number right now.
I'm so nervous she's gonna pick me.
Eight, you are eliminated.
I can't believe I got eliminated.
Bye Bye, Shop expree.
Congratulations.
You are the final five.
Moving on to the next challenge.
Head
through the tunnel.
We just eliminated three players,
but remember,
only one is gonna win that $1,000.
Comment below who you think it is.
Oh, my goodness.
Finally we can get a break.
Yeah.
At least we can relax.
So who you guys think is gonna win?
I think I might have the best shot.
15's been way too quiet, man.
It's just not built for the competition.
18 needs to back off.
15,
she's a great leader and she
hasn't done anything to him.
Yeah,
I think you should stop
talking because you got,
like,
half of Our team eliminated.
18,
guys,
who are we voting out
if it comes to a vote?
Well,
I think number seven is
the youngest one here,
so I just won.
The entire Last game,
so you should not be talking.
If I have a chance,
I'm totally,
totally getting 18 now.
The contestants think they're relaxing,
but they have no idea that one of
them is about to be eliminated.
Guards, bring it up.
Contestants, please come forward.
Here are five mystery boxes.
Each of them have something inside,
but you don't know if
it's good or if it's bad.
You will each have to pick a
box to give to another player.
18,
since you are the oldest,
you will get to pick first.
Oh, gosh, I'm gonna do this shiny one.
What player would you
like to give that to?
You look like you really want it.
So I'm gonna give it to you.
Please hold the box.
Do not open the box until I say.
Next up, 17.
So I'm gonna go number three.
I think I'm gonna give
this to my team captain.
Number 15.
$1,000 is on the line,
and the fate of your hands
is in another contestant.
15,
pick a box and a contestant to give it to.
My favorite color's pink.
Okay, so I'm gonna give it to 14.
Okay.
I have a good feeling about this one,
honestly.
14, you're up.
I'm gonna pick number four,
and I'm gonna give it to 18.
7.
There is only one remaining box and
one player that doesn't have one.
So please give it to contestant number 17.
Now that we have our boxes,
we will be opening,
starting with box number one.
Contestant number 14,
please open your box.
It's prime, in case you're thirsty.
Number two, you are the next one.
Open your box.
Oh, it's a board game.
Our board game that
you can get at Walmart.
I know what game I'm playing tonight.
Number three.
Beast.
Feastables.
And Jimmy gave out $100 per Feastable,
which is now yours.
No, see, Kathleen helped you.
I didn't get eliminated,
and I won a hundred dollars.
And now
box number four.
Oh, I'm scared.
Oh.
Got some Zamfam bows that
you can get at Walmart.
You should try it on.
It actually look good in your hair.
You might have to help me.
Cause I've never put on a bow.
Comment down below if you've
bought these bows yet.
If not, go get them at Walmart.
This could be lucky.
I like it.
And finally, we have box number five.
Go ahead and open your box.
number seven.
Unfortunately, you are eliminated.
I can't believe 18 just did that to me.
I'm glad I sent her.
Take her away.
Our youngest remaining
competitor just got eliminated.
And if you think that was bad.
Things are gonna get even more cutthroat,
and you're gonna question
who you can trust.
They are about to enter the most
difficult part of this challenge.
No matter what the next challenge is,
we can't vote each other out.
We have to stick together.
Truth.
Come on in and have a seat at a.
This game is called the circle of trust.
Each of you will be blindfolded,
and I will walk around
and tap someone on the shoulder.
If I tap you on the shoulder,
you must come grab this box and
place it on the desk of the
player you wish to eliminate.
If you are the person with that box,
you have a chance to guess who you
think put the box on your desk.
If you get it right, they're eliminated.
If you get it wrong, you are eliminated.
If the box ends up on my desk,
it could be any of them.
They all want me out.
Guards,
please place their blindfolds on their.
Let the circle of trust begin.
Oh, no.
Rebecca chose me, but it's okay.
I have an idea.
My thought is everybody thinks
that I'm gonna go for 18
because we're kind of enemies,
so I'm gonna go for 17 instead,
because I don't think that 17
will think that I chose him.
Man time.
Everyone
take down your blindfolds.
Ooh.
No way.
17, it looks like you have the box.
I will give you a chance to go
interrogate the other contestants
before you make your decision.
All right.
Was it U15?
Even though you're my captain,
it wasn't me.
All right,
I'm gonna keep you as a suspect,
bro.
18.
I don't know.
Are you trying to get me out
because you think I'm a threat?
We were in this together from the start.
I didn't put that there.
I hope you're not just saying that.
And lastly,
I don't even know what number you are.
I'm 14.
You were talking about
getting me a number.
18 out.
I did say I would get 18 out first.
You said 17
oldest to the youngest.
I think I know who picked me.
Please grab the black box
and place it on the table.
Now,
please call up the person you
think put the box on your desk.
I think it's this number
because she was talking about
getting me and number 18 out earlier.
I think it could be a trick that she
just wants to get me out instead of 18
to throw me off.
So I think the person who put
their box on my desk was number 14.
Will you step up?
I think he's on to something.
Okay, 17
inside.
This box is the number
of the player who chose to eliminate you.
If your guess is right,
they will be eliminated.
However,
if your guess is wrong,
you will be eliminated.
Are you ready to open the box?
14.
I knew it was 14.
14...
did, in fact place the box of elimination
on your desk, which means
14, you are eliminated.
Try to get me out.
I'm really bummed that 17 chose me.
I was almost sure he was
gonna choose 18 instead,
but it's okay.
At least I beat my siblings.
Well,
it looks like we are down to
our final three squid game.
Contestants,
please head to your next challenge.
Man, that was too close.
I'm winning this.
This is the gumball rolling challenge.
Each of you has five gumballs
that you will roll one by one.
The two players closest to
the triangle will move on.
The one with the farthest
gumball will be eliminated.
17, you're up first.
You guys can roll from anywhere here,
as long as it's behind the white line.
It looks like both rolls
were a little too hard.
‚Ç¨18
so far,
green is the closest,
but no one is anywhere
close to the triangle.
17, you're up.
Holy crap.
Pretty close.
A little too hard.
15.
18.
Dang it.
I chose the wrong gumball.
This is gumball number three.
Not enough umph on that one.
Okay, 15, you're currently in third place.
$11,000 is on the line.
You have currently moved to second place.
Right now,
purple is still in the lead,
but you have outbeat.
18.
Come on,
18,
it looks like you are back in the game.
You're back in second place,
but each person still
has two more gumballs,
so it's anyone's game.
I thought it was getting in there,
but it just kept rolling.
This is all based on look.
I definitely think it's scale.
17, you are up.
What is your strategy for this one?
This time, be a little more gentle.
That one rolled a little the wrong way.
Okay,
15,
if you get it in the triangle,
you could move on to win
that thousand dollars.
How important is this roll?
Really important,
But I am going to save
my best gumball for last.
17 and 18 are still the
closest to the triangle,
but as we know,
in this game,
things can change at any second.
And 18,
how important is it for you to get it
in that triangle so you can move
on and win that thousand dollars?
I've came all this way.
I'm not going home now.
Little too hard.
Eighteen just kept rolling.
This time,
there is still a chance that both
the other players could knock
you out of your lead position.
You have one gumball to save it.
Do you think you can get in that triangle?
This is my last one.
I'm going to get everything I have.
O.
It's not in the triangle,
but it is very close.
We still cannot say for
sure that you are moving on.
You're the only.
Only girl left.
Do you think you can make
it to the final round?
I think so.
This is my last marble.
I have to make it in the triangle.
That did not roll very far.
18, you are currently in second.
There's a chance you
could knock yours out.
Are you nervous?
A little bit.
You are the last
one to roll on this.
So whatever you do will
determine who gets eliminated
and who
moves on to the finals.
I got this.
Okay.
Pressure's on.
18.
Number 17,
you are the closest to the triangle.
Number 18,
after measuring it,
you are the second closest,
which means,
unfortunately,
our only remote remaining girl,
15,
has been eliminated.
I wish you guys luck,
especially 17,
because he has been the best to me,
and I'm glad that I won a hundred dollars.
I'm sad I got eliminated,
but this competition made
me a lot more confident.
I'll be back.
15 was a great competitor,
and she did a great job.
This is the moment we
have been waiting for.
The final challenge that will
determine who will win the $1,000.
This is it.
My chance to win that $1,000.
I came here to win,
and I'm gonna get that
thousand dollars behind you.
$1,000.
But it's locked up,
and you need to find the key.
You guys will be playing a game of rock,
paper,
scissors.
If
you win,
you will have three seconds to
choose a key to go in that lock.
The first person to find the
key wins the thousand dollars.
Are you guys ready?
I'm ready.
Time to play rock,
paper,
scissors lock in your first choice.
Three, two, one.
Reveal.
Paper beats rock.
Three seconds.
One, two, three.
It doesn't work.
Rock, paper, scissors.
Scissors beats paper.
3, 2, 1.
3, 2, 1.
3, 2, 1.
Oh, my.
Rock beat scissors.
1, 2, 3.
Hit.
No way.
It got him,
but it's not unlocking the lock.
Too close.
Three, two, one.
Let me choose this guy.
No way.
That is not the key.
come on, Keith.
Doesn't look like it fits.
Oh, my gosh.
This is getting too close.
How are you feeling right now, 17?
I'm a little nervous,
but I'm so hopeful that
I'll get a key that works.
I think it's anyone's game, honestly.
This is all luck right here.
You both have come this far.
To go home with nothing would
be extremely disappointing.
Rock, paper, scissors.
Reveal in 3, 2, 1.
No way.
Paper beats rock.
I'm going to choose
1, 2, 3.
No
way.
you
just
won
the thousand
dollars.
How do you feel right now?
This is crazy.
I'm so grateful.
Congratulations.
And now,
17,
you also get to sign your name
on the golden Z for a chance
to compete for $10,000.
Number 17 is the winner of Squid Game.

Number 14, are you nervous?
Yeah, a little bit.
Green light.
A little bit.
Number two,
Everyone is finished except you.
Are you gonna try to cross the line?
No.
Go ahead and take her away.
I just eliminated my daughter.
And these challenges are
gonna get even harder.
Congratulations, everyone here.
You are moving on to the next round.
Round
Red light,
green light is the easiest challenge,
and we already eliminated
four contestants.
Contestants, please stand on your number.
The game you will be
playing is Squid says.
If squid doesn't say
to do it and you do it,
you will be eliminated.
Squid says put your arms up in the air.
Squid says put your arms out to the side.
Put your arms
down.
Squid didn't say, put your hands down.
I have to eliminate you.
Take them out.
Squid says put your arms down.
Squid says
say, I'm Sigma.
I'm Sigma.
Squid says turn to the right.
Number five, turn to the left.
I'm sorry.
All right, you did a full circle.
You didn't just turn to your right.
Okay,
I'm sorry.
Squid says point to
someone that scares you.
7.
You're pointing to 18.
Is it because he's the oldest guy in here?
18.
You are pointing to 17.
I feel like he's my only competition.
You're pointing at number nine.
Number nine was talking trash earlier.
Well, who are you pointing to?
Oh, back in.
Okay, you two.
11 and 16 are pointing to you.
Why do you think they're scared of you?
Cause I'm taller.
Number nine, your brother.
Why does he scare you?
Because he won the Roblox,
so I think he's pretty tough.
Competitors.
Squid says put your arms down.
Squid says say,
I'm moving on to the next round.
I'm moving on to the next round.
Congratulations, everyone here.
But if you want to win
that thousand dollars,
it is going to get a lot harder.
We've already eliminated six,
which means we are down to our final 12.
But only one will win the thousand
dollars before we find out
what the next challenge is.
I need you guys to do subscribe.
We're trying to hit 18 million
by the end of the year.
So join the zam fam.
And now
let's bring in the contestants.
Have a seat in front of a popsicle stick.
Now that you are all sitting down,
this is a game of duck,
duck,
goose.
If you are the goose,
you must tag someone and sprint
around and get to their spot
without them tagging you.
If they tag you, you go in the mush pot.
If they don't tag you,
they go in the mush pot.
Whoever is in the mush pot at
the end is up for elimination.
Everyone grab your stick.
What does yours say?
Duck, Duck, Duck.
Duck.
Duck.
Duck.
Goose.
It looks like number eight
is starting off as our goose.
Go ahead.
Duck, duck, duck, Duck, Duck.
Goose.
Oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh.
Number 16.
I did not tag number eight,
which means she goes in the mush pot.
Number six.
Now you get to choose
someone to be the goose.
Which number do you want to choose?
Three, two, one.
I'm really bad at duck, duck, goose.
I hope I don't get picked.
You're gonna go whet me McQueen on you.
Number 10.
You get to choose someone to be a goose.
Remember,
who you choose could also
end up in this mush pot.
Who are you gonna choose?
Number 11.
Okay, number 11.
Duck,
duck,
duck, duck, goose.
Oh, man.
This is it.
Number...
seven.
You tagged her,
which means 11 is in the mush pot.
I was not expecting her to be that fast.
I knew I was gonna catch her.
All of you are up for elimination.
But we will let the remaining
contestants decide who that person is.
You have one minute to discuss.
Guys,
I think we get the highest number
because they posed the biggest threat.
No, I think
number six.
Number six.
Guys, not on number 11.
Just raise your hand for number 11.
I have no idea which one
they are gonna choose,
but one of them is going to be eliminated.
Raise your hand for number six.
And
time.
Who have you chosen?
Number six.
Okay, I'm sorry.
Number six.
They got me out, but I'll be back.
The youngest player left in
this game just got eliminated.
I was not expecting that.
Thank you, guys for not voting for me.
But why didn't you?
I'm the oldest.
Would have been the smartest move...
I did.
Congratulations.
Everyone here is moving
on to the next round.
For this challenge,
we're gonna find out who the leaders
are and how well they work with a team.
Come on in.
You're right, clo.
In case you can't tell
this game is Battleship.
Now,
if you have an even number,
I want you to stand over here.
If you have an odd number, stand here.
Now that you guys are lit up,
these are your teams.
You will need to pick a team.
Captain, you have one minute to discuss.
I don't know.
I think it's between you
and you.
I vote 15.
I vote 15 as well.
I chose number 15 as captain
because she said she had a lot
of experience in Battleship.
17 seems to be looking out for me.
I think he's the right one to trust.
Everyone come forward.
Even team, who is Your captain?
Number 18.
With him as our captain,
I think our team's gonna win.
He better not lose this.
They picked me as captain,
but the only person I'm
looking out for is me.
And odd team, who is your captain?
Number 15.
15.
We were gonna pick 17,
but he had never played.
So we picked the second oldest.
I'm really shy.
I don't know why they
picked me as captain.
The way this challenge works
is the captain will place your
boats and make the calls.
The first boat that sinks gets eliminated.
Guards, bring forward the boats.
Go ahead
and place your boat.
I think we should move that one.
Because if they get the big one,
they're gonna have no
idea there's another.
One next to it.
It looks like both are trying
to cause a distraction,
but let's see if the
other team falls for it.
And
time.
Wherever you are at,
you must stay on your ship.
It looks like the team captain on
this side chose the one person boat,
which means if he gets out,
he sacrificed himself.
Feel nervous?
Our captain made great decisions.
I'm not nervous at all.
Let the Battleship game begin.
Even,
since you have more people,
you get to go first.
Make your first pick.
We're gonna take B4.
Let's see if that's a hit or a miss.
That is a myth.
Odd captain, it's your turn.
That is A.
I can't believe they already
found one of our ships.
18.
The choice you make could determine
whether or not you are one
step closer to winning $1,000.
What is your next play?
There.
So far, the Evens have got
no ships yet.
Let's see if the odds can take them out.
What is your next play?
That is a hit.
You have another hit,
but no ship has gone down yet.
Evens, it's your play.
I'm so happy we hit one of theirs.
I was so nervous when
they picked 15 square.
I was right below her.
Evens are back in the game.
At this point, anyone can win Battleship.
15.
You have two hits,
which means there's a three
person boat somewhere.
You could go either way.
Do you know which way you're gonna go?
Yes.
If they choose a four,
our captain is gone.
D4.
D4.
Are you sure?
This could be the difference
between winning or losing $1,000?
Yeah, I'm sure.
D4
is a
hit.
D4
was a hit
and a sink,
which means the odds win Battleship.
I'm proud of 15.
She really stepped up.
I can't believe this.
Unfortunately,
you three were on the boat that got sank,
which means
all three of you are eliminated.
No, no high back, no high five.
You just got three of
your teammates eliminated.
How do you feel?
Not great.
But it wasn't my square.
So our captain was selfish.
He didn't even care.
We lost three people.
18's reaction after the other
boat sank instead of his shows.
He's playing for himself.
It's not my fault.
They're the ones who chose me as captain.
If you had picked the other way,
you would have gotten out 18.
Now though, everyone
is moving on to the next round.
So head to the tunnel.
This is getting crazier.
And the competitiveness in each of
these players is definitely show.
They're not gonna like
this next challenge.
We all know in squid game you
need a little bit of luck.
So let's see how they do.
Bring in the contestant.
Come on over
it turn on.
In here is a ball with your number on it.
Please go ahead and grab it.
Now that you have your number,
we're gonna play a game
called odd or even.
Two of you will go at a time and
you'll have to guess if I'm
gonna roll an odd or an even.
If you are wrong,
you will place your ball into here.
Let's start with the lowest...
highest number.
Seven and 18, please step forward.
Do you think I'm going to roll?
And odd or even?
Step into the square you
think is going to be right.
Oh, looks like he both chose different.
Let's see who is right.
Oh, yeah.
Even
your wrong.
Your ball
is going in here.
17...
and 8, please step forward.
Do you want to choose odd like
him or do you want to do even?
We're going down together.
I rolled a three,
which is odd,
which means both of you are right.
You get to keep your ball
and get back in line.
Fifteen
and nine, please step forward.
Odd are an even number two,
you're both doing odd.
Let's see.
five
is odd,
which means both of you get to
keep your numbers 11 and 14,
please step forward.
You both are going even.
Let's see.
I rolled a three,
which means you guys are wrong.
Everyone
that's still has their number,
please step forward.
You now need to decide am
I gonna roll odd or even?
I usually always pick odd.
It's my lucky side.
You are putting $1,000 potentially
on the line for an even.
I'm confident.
You guys are feeling confident with odds.
Let's see.
What I rol.
Even
is right.
I rolled a six,
which means all of you,
please put your numbers in here.
Guess I'm not so lucky today.
Only one of you
will win this.
The other has the potential to
be eliminated like everyone else.
So I'm about to roll.
Do you think it'll be even or odd?
They're both choosing the same.
You both could be out,
and you both could lose.
Are you changing
I was standing on odd,
but my gut was just telling me to go even.
You said evens were your lucky number.
Only one of you is going to win this.
The other will put
their number into
even.
Won.
Number eight is putting
her ball into the mix.
Number seven,
please step to the side as you are safe.
Everyone here is up for elimination
except for number seven,
who won that game.
So I will be picking three numbers and
those three numbers will be eliminated.
Sign in.
I'm praying she doesn't pick my number.
It's right next to her hand.
Eleven,
you are eliminated.
And then there are two.
Just like that,
your chance at $1,000 will be over.
Nine.
Nine, you are eliminated.
And the final number being eliminated is.
Rebecca's hand is right
by my number right now.
I'm so nervous she's gonna pick me.
Eight, you are eliminated.
I can't believe I got eliminated.
Bye Bye, Shop expree.
Congratulations.
You are the final five.
Moving on to the next challenge.
Head
through the tunnel.
We just eliminated three players,
but remember,
only one is gonna win that $1,000.
Comment below who you think it is.
Oh, my goodness.
Finally we can get a break.
Yeah.
At least we can relax.
So who you guys think is gonna win?
I think I might have the best shot.
15's been way too quiet, man.
It's just not built for the competition.
18 needs to back off.
15,
she's a great leader and she
hasn't done anything to him.
Yeah,
I think you should stop
talking because you got,
like,
half of Our team eliminated.
18,
guys,
who are we voting out
if it comes to a vote?
Well,
I think number seven is
the youngest one here,
so I just won.
The entire Last game,
so you should not be talking.
If I have a chance,
I'm totally,
totally getting 18 now.
The contestants think they're relaxing,
but they have no idea that one of
them is about to be eliminated.
Guards, bring it up.
Contestants, please come forward.
Here are five mystery boxes.
Each of them have something inside,
but you don't know if
it's good or if it's bad.
You will each have to pick a
box to give to another player.
18,
since you are the oldest,
you will get to pick first.
Oh, gosh, I'm gonna do this shiny one.
What player would you
like to give that to?
You look like you really want it.
So I'm gonna give it to you.
Please hold the box.
Do not open the box until I say.
Next up, 17.
So I'm gonna go number three.
I think I'm gonna give
this to my team captain.
Number 15.
$1,000 is on the line,
and the fate of your hands
is in another contestant.
15,
pick a box and a contestant to give it to.
My favorite color's pink.
Okay, so I'm gonna give it to 14.
Okay.
I have a good feeling about this one,
honestly.
14, you're up.
I'm gonna pick number four,
and I'm gonna give it to 18.
7.
There is only one remaining box and
one player that doesn't have one.
So please give it to contestant number 17.
Now that we have our boxes,
we will be opening,
starting with box number one.
Contestant number 14,
please open your box.
It's prime, in case you're thirsty.
Number two, you are the next one.
Open your box.
Oh, it's a board game.
Our board game that
you can get at Walmart.
I know what game I'm playing tonight.
Number three.
Beast.
Feastables.
And Jimmy gave out $100 per Feastable,
which is now yours.
No, see, Kathleen helped you.
I didn't get eliminated,
and I won a hundred dollars.
And now
box number four.
Oh, I'm scared.
Oh.
Got some Zamfam bows that
you can get at Walmart.
You should try it on.
It actually look good in your hair.
You might have to help me.
Cause I've never put on a bow.
Comment down below if you've
bought these bows yet.
If not, go get them at Walmart.
This could be lucky.
I like it.
And finally, we have box number five.
Go ahead and open your box.
number seven.
Unfortunately, you are eliminated.
I can't believe 18 just did that to me.
I'm glad I sent her.
Take her away.
Our youngest remaining
competitor just got eliminated.
And if you think that was bad.
Things are gonna get even more cutthroat,
and you're gonna question
who you can trust.
They are about to enter the most
difficult part of this challenge.
No matter what the next challenge is,
we can't vote each other out.
We have to stick together.
Truth.
Come on in and have a seat at a.
This game is called the circle of trust.
Each of you will be blindfolded,
and I will walk around
and tap someone on the shoulder.
If I tap you on the shoulder,
you must come grab this box and
place it on the desk of the
player you wish to eliminate.
If you are the person with that box,
you have a chance to guess who you
think put the box on your desk.
If you get it right, they're eliminated.
If you get it wrong, you are eliminated.
If the box ends up on my desk,
it could be any of them.
They all want me out.
Guards,
please place their blindfolds on their.
Let the circle of trust begin.
Oh, no.
Rebecca chose me, but it's okay.
I have an idea.
My thought is everybody thinks
that I'm gonna go for 18
because we're kind of enemies,
so I'm gonna go for 17 instead,
because I don't think that 17
will think that I chose him.
Man time.
Everyone
take down your blindfolds.
Ooh.
No way.
17, it looks like you have the box.
I will give you a chance to go
interrogate the other contestants
before you make your decision.
All right.
Was it U15?
Even though you're my captain,
it wasn't me.
All right,
I'm gonna keep you as a suspect,
bro.
18.
I don't know.
Are you trying to get me out
because you think I'm a threat?
We were in this together from the start.
I didn't put that there.
I hope you're not just saying that.
And lastly,
I don't even know what number you are.
I'm 14.
You were talking about
getting me a number.
18 out.
I did say I would get 18 out first.
You said 17
oldest to the youngest.
I think I know who picked me.
Please grab the black box
and place it on the table.
Now,
please call up the person you
think put the box on your desk.
I think it's this number
because she was talking about
getting me and number 18 out earlier.
I think it could be a trick that she
just wants to get me out instead of 18
to throw me off.
So I think the person who put
their box on my desk was number 14.
Will you step up?
I think he's on to something.
Okay, 17
inside.
This box is the number
of the player who chose to eliminate you.
If your guess is right,
they will be eliminated.
However,
if your guess is wrong,
you will be eliminated.
Are you ready to open the box?
14.
I knew it was 14.
14...
did, in fact place the box of elimination
on your desk, which means
14, you are eliminated.
Try to get me out.
I'm really bummed that 17 chose me.
I was almost sure he was
gonna choose 18 instead,
but it's okay.
At least I beat my siblings.
Well,
it looks like we are down to
our final three squid game.
Contestants,
please head to your next challenge.
Man, that was too close.
I'm winning this.
This is the gumball rolling challenge.
Each of you has five gumballs
that you will roll one by one.
The two players closest to
the triangle will move on.
The one with the farthest
gumball will be eliminated.
17, you're up first.
You guys can roll from anywhere here,
as long as it's behind the white line.
It looks like both rolls
were a little too hard.
‚Ç¨18
so far,
green is the closest,
but no one is anywhere
close to the triangle.
17, you're up.
Holy crap.
Pretty close.
A little too hard.
15.
18.
Dang it.
I chose the wrong gumball.
This is gumball number three.
Not enough umph on that one.
Okay, 15, you're currently in third place.
$11,000 is on the line.
You have currently moved to second place.
Right now,
purple is still in the lead,
but you have outbeat.
18.
Come on,
18,
it looks like you are back in the game.
You're back in second place,
but each person still
has two more gumballs,
so it's anyone's game.
I thought it was getting in there,
but it just kept rolling.
This is all based on look.
I definitely think it's scale.
17, you are up.
What is your strategy for this one?
This time, be a little more gentle.
That one rolled a little the wrong way.
Okay,
15,
if you get it in the triangle,
you could move on to win
that thousand dollars.
How important is this roll?
Really important,
But I am going to save
my best gumball for last.
17 and 18 are still the
closest to the triangle,
but as we know,
in this game,
things can change at any second.
And 18,
how important is it for you to get it
in that triangle so you can move
on and win that thousand dollars?
I've came all this way.
I'm not going home now.
Little too hard.
Eighteen just kept rolling.
This time,
there is still a chance that both
the other players could knock
you out of your lead position.
You have one gumball to save it.
Do you think you can get in that triangle?
This is my last one.
I'm going to get everything I have.
O.
It's not in the triangle,
but it is very close.
We still cannot say for
sure that you are moving on.
You're the only.
Only girl left.
Do you think you can make
it to the final round?
I think so.
This is my last marble.
I have to make it in the triangle.
That did not roll very far.
18, you are currently in second.
There's a chance you
could knock yours out.
Are you nervous?
A little bit.
You are the last
one to roll on this.
So whatever you do will
determine who gets eliminated
and who
moves on to the finals.
I got this.
Okay.
Pressure's on.
18.
Number 17,
you are the closest to the triangle.
Number 18,
after measuring it,
you are the second closest,
which means,
unfortunately,
our only remote remaining girl,
15,
has been eliminated.
I wish you guys luck,
especially 17,
because he has been the best to me,
and I'm glad that I won a hundred dollars.
I'm sad I got eliminated,
but this competition made
me a lot more confident.
I'll be back.
15 was a great competitor,
and she did a great job.
This is the moment we
have been waiting for.
The final challenge that will
determine who will win the $1,000.
This is it.
My chance to win that $1,000.
I came here to win,
and I'm gonna get that
thousand dollars behind you.
$1,000.
But it's locked up,
and you need to find the key.
You guys will be playing a game of rock,
paper,
scissors.
If
you win,
you will have three seconds to
choose a key to go in that lock.
The first person to find the
key wins the thousand dollars.
Are you guys ready?
I'm ready.
Time to play rock,
paper,
scissors lock in your first choice.
Three, two, one.
Reveal.
Paper beats rock.
Three seconds.
One, two, three.
It doesn't work.
Rock, paper, scissors.
Scissors beats paper.
3, 2, 1.
3, 2, 1.
3, 2, 1.
Oh, my.
Rock beat scissors.
1, 2, 3.
Hit.
No way.
It got him,
but it's not unlocking the lock.
Too close.
Three, two, one.
Let me choose this guy.
No way.
That is not the key.
come on, Keith.
Doesn't look like it fits.
Oh, my gosh.
This is getting too close.
How are you feeling right now, 17?
I'm a little nervous,
but I'm so hopeful that
I'll get a key that works.
I think it's anyone's game, honestly.
This is all luck right here.
You both have come this far.
To go home with nothing would
be extremely disappointing.
Rock, paper, scissors.
Reveal in 3, 2, 1.
No way.
Paper beats rock.
I'm going to choose
1, 2, 3.
No
way.
you
just
won
the thousand
dollars.
How do you feel right now?
This is crazy.
I'm so grateful.
Congratulations.
And now,
17,
you also get to sign your name
on the golden Z for a chance
to compete for $10,000.
Number 17 is the winner of Squid Game.

five spins around and launches it long
one1 coverage over the shoulder catch by
Ty Johnson and the Bills pick up a big
gain of 33 yds third and
five as Allen has time now
slides looks flings it he's got him down
to the 6yd line that's Johnson with a
second Big Catch of the drive why don't
you go up and just push the big guy
second and goal that's what they're
going to do pushing pushing bills think
he's across do the officials agree looks
like they're going to spot him short no
it's a touchdown there it is just took a
while touchdown
Buffalo his 10th rushing touchdown of
the
Season he's just riding on the back of a
Lions
player well they theyve
actually made this math where they find
the little Leverage What side to go and
they use the push tush there and on a
second and nine G completes it and has a
first
down and that system is really hard to
go against the old Jin Johnson system
he's evolved it here's a third and 13
bills Rush four they're in on him again
ball came out recovered by one of the
linemen it's be a significant loss again
it was Ed Oliver who was in on Golf and
was recovered by Kevin zeitler stay in
the chase for the host role as Kansas
City won at Cleveland today even though
Patrick Mahomes injured an ankle did not
finish the game here's Allen again
extending the play and finding receiver
another running back down the field this
time it's cook what a start for Buffalo
right now this is a huge moment
K finds his Target it's Shakir tiptoeing
to the first down he refused to go down
who has deep ties with Dan Campbell
Lions head
coach as Cook gets the call not even
touch as he's got the first down and
that uh Jersey gets stretched out for
about three yards fights through it
picks up a first Collins who dangerous
to the left he is big and it's Allen
easily going in hopping home for the
touch
[Applause]
down we just talked about the tackle
pull and they do it again and this is
what we call a tackle pole you can give
the ball to Josh Allen he sees the
numbers and that's where some of the
young guys you know they're doing it
this week on the road second and 12
setting up the screen and that's Gibbs
Gibbs who's so dangerous look at him
fight for that first down and he's rid
down by Jordan Phillips out of bounds
first and
10 they go to Gibbs looking him break
outside on Benfield Ford on Ben for and
that's just a great example of what he
can
[Applause]
do n Go toss and is cominging back over
to off who's going to unload it down the
field to a wide openen Target on Mon r s
Brown that's what second and short can
offer you Rand El's just good enough to
throw it this time they had to go with
golf yeah that's right on a room here
that is Gibbs taking it to the 13 as the
lions come racing back down the
field on Third and
nine G looking throwing caught first
down and touchdown Tim Patrick with a
stellar effort
the off
schedule throws by Jared gol as you see
Patrick giv the extra effort what an
outstanding play by Patrick who's really
come on unselfish tough he has that
length and you see the link being shown
off right there but Jared G's ability to
extend the play here he had some off
schedule throws last week that were off
the chart this tied coming into the week
with KC for the best Mark over the last
40 this is a the first and 20 now for
Allen and the bills and wide open with
the catch that's Knox Dawson Knox for 19
yds and they're going to go up top for
it guns It Wide of the Mark just barely
trying to find concade and now you got a
fourth and two fourth at about two and
1/2 play clock down the one and they're
going for
it looking down wide open and pulled
down by Ty Johnson who's got another 20
plus yd reception his third of the game
you have to find the guy that's not as
good as the other guy and they're doing
it right now first and goal give cook no
one near him goes in untouched for the
Buffalo
touchdown surf technique means you have
to
play the ball first and then you surf
toward the quarterback it's really on
the other side but we'll use it there
and just a fin up he go Ty Johnson the
best third round back in the league does
Josh Allen he's found him four times so
here's being down G finding one at his
targets that's Jameson
Williams he's got a nice grab his first
catch of the day goes for 19 four yards
to go for the
first here's the pass on the
mark St Brown has the first
down third and 10
in
trouble somehow escapes going to take
off which he seldom does and he has the
first
[Applause]
down fake it to him this time and they
got a wide open Target it's one of the
linemen it's Skipper to the end zone for
the
touchdown Dan
Skipper all 6'9 of them so they put him
at the tight end position and after the
motion you block block block and just
skip out of there Mr Skipper and look at
this I want to hit you get over
here
Skipper he was on an island right here
he was and look he could easily run over
the cour no I want to see you get over
here here's Allen slipping out of the
sack looking way down the field as a man
has got to step and is caught it's
caught all the way inside the 10 yd line
and fighting all the way down to the
five is Keon Coleman there is a flag
back at the line of
scrimmage Allen sliding again to his
right to the end zone he throws it it's
knocked away going for
Hollands and that kick is no good oh my
goodness they had it down to the 2y line
of injuries continue to grow for this
Detroit Lions team so down two corners
in this game first and 10 he's G
connects that's leaport up and again the
bills keep trying to punch the football
out without any
success you see Detroit just that
feeling right here they come on second
and two down the middle and open again
at the 34 yd
line pick up of 16 trying to as good a
disguise team as there is and then they
send it coming in pass
incomplete off the fingertips of V
manra 52 yds and he matches the Miss of
bass although this was past 50 that's
his first Miss of the year in the
offseason at Pine Valley and the belir
country club the here's a second and six
ah
Allen got away from the pocket and
throws it complete to Johnson with the
flag
out second and four staying on the
ground to cook nice Cut cook taken off
he actually almost got stopped but he's
going home for the
touchdown they almost grabbed him by the
hair at one time he slowed him down he
broke
free why do you are you allowed to
tackle the hair Spencer Brown pulling
again and right here you'll
see cook almost goes down with a pull
and that is
legal here's the hair
pull 41 yds for cook his second
touchdown he injured his knee in that
Thanksgiving Day game I mentioned back
in 22 here against the Lions he's in on
this play as they got to
Goff and Oliver was the first Russo
added
in second and
eight pass caught look at Davis the
rookie lunges forward to pick up the
first
[Applause]
down look at Allen with the keep and
knows where he's got to go to pick up
the
first they're going to play manto Man
everyone's
man second down and
10 he an open Lane for Allen makes one
wiggle to get around the defender Turner
and another Scramble for 11 and a
[Applause]
first third and
12 good tackle that time as Shakir is
stopped short of the chains by Robertson
we'll call it the four yd line to start
this
series backing up at setting up a screen
to
Montgomery he's got a nice gain get him
out of that
pickle got a first down out of it now
more pressure coming in on G comes back
to near side and again great catch by
Montgomery chugs along nearly lost of
football for a second picks up 11 and
another first right now he wants to love
the last quarter and a half he does he
want something out of this drive here's
gof down to field and he connects
Patrick lost
it and
Gibbs looks like Milano has the recovery
[Applause]
I mean that was a big time throw
absolutely
perfect McNeil here got carded off as
they go now to cook and that's right
where he would
be third down and
two they go with cook he's got the first
Bo he's taking Three Lions two lions
with him down to the 10 yd
line watch the play
action oh little shuffle pass and it's
Shakir with the Buffalo
[Applause]
touchdown I think this is going to be a
throwing touchdown because it's a sneaky
play action got another one today you
keep talking about pulling you get an
extra guy to come back to the run so you
get numbers and everyone thinks it's
going right you can't find the
ball second and
10 open got him in stride and Gibbs
got the first out markh pass the
sticks here's a third and
17 the pass complete St Brown slips
through a tackle inside the 20 to the 10
what a play on Third and 17 the lions
are back in
it watch this we saw
the the throw deep earlier this was
equally as good as he gets a ball roped
right to him and surprises St Brown and
he does the rest what a throw and catch
and
Detroit Allen going long perfect pass
right over the shoulder to K Cade who
counts as two Defenders double coverage
yes gain of
29 third and six
the kinds of
time dangerous when he does this cross
his body throws and it's knocked down he
was going for Coleman and that's Arnold
the rookie who batted it away to try to
make it a three-score margin Martin on
the hold this kick that's a beauty what
a way to recover mentally promising
promising young player carded to the
locker room Karem Jackson's come in for
him 's the pass to pick up the first
down dib shoved
[Applause]
out down the middle throws a
strike down to the 16 yd line with
leaport 336 three touchdowns you don't
normally win but they have the lead
second and four dumps it off
G got
across touchdown lions
when GBS gets the ball just a simple
check down Bernard nope and then
finishes it off with Kem Jackson coming
in after
Bishop had to be carded off and wow
Detroit twice gets back in the game very
quickly yeah that took two minutes and
two seconds to go the 70 yd seems a
little early Tony but here we go 12
minutes to onside kick ball bounces
around it's picked up by Hollands and
he's running with it Hollands tackled
down at the 5 yd
line well if you don't think you can
stop a team you're trying to steal a
possession right they would have tried
to surprise one but you have to declare
it now now Allen short toss easy doing
touchdown bills Davis the
recipient now they're going to try to
add another one on top of their total
here here Josh made it a little harder
than it needed to be that's a season
ending injury Trace right there Jim and
he's got a chance to come back that's
crazy he was on fire first down throw on
the sideline
threaded take advantage of the secondary
issues and all the
people middle of the field it's leaport
with a stiff arm on Spectre that picks
up another five or six yards and a first
down they're going to play some Zone
some Zone pressures like right here and
just softly take it's in front of you
Baron Johnson able to bring leaport down
this time Allen Robinson third and seven
manto man here comes the blitz beats it
and look at leaport a fight off Lewis to
pick up another Detroit first the C was
telling us though they spend so much
time on the Red Zone in third down they
call them four-point plays here's St
Brown that keeps that drive going
was no snap hand off Gibs pushed across
oh my goodness one of the L made that
happen and it looked like maybe it was
Su watch it come over it is it's pan
look at that he just shoves him across
that's a great call you were
right only one guy back here's Allen
take the hand off now just lobs it oh it
was caught What A Catch by tosson Knox
as Josh probably couldn't believe he was
that wide open and he almost overthrew
him Knox reeled it in great catch dson
Knox first and 10 now Allen taking off
he's got all kinds of room and slides
down at the 22 yd
line now to the short side Allen's got
the first down and leaps down to the 10
yd
line here it's third and goal and they
still have everyone here Buffalo runs it
with
Davis and they're going to force the
Lions to take a timeout
here they may have snapped it a little
too soon they're going to get at 203 you
just got to go something like this
corner FL second and 10 down the middle
they go the porter bouncing around
tackled in the field to play you still
have all three you'll get another crack
at it with a three and out there's goth
again middle of the field to giving it
to him leaport putting up some big
numbers
himself you know Detroit's just
decimated as well they'll be better when
the time comes a fourth and 10 oh look
at the play they have drawn up as Gibs
takes it on the old hooking ladder W
fourth down and they pick up the first
at the 13 ydd line with 33 seconds
cross the middle they go timeout take a
time out right down to the three BR and
it's called would they dare run it
they've run for only 48 yards today in
this game you can cuz you're going to
use your timeout what are you saving
them for you're exactly right top to the
end zone They Go they've got it it's
Jameson Williams J with the
touchdown oh I want you to watch he's
going to break in Benford has leverage
and J changes it and I know a little
Jameson J N that's going to love that
these guys go hit the defender you go
catch it here we go oh straight up the
middle and there's a scrum for it oh my
goodness did the Lions recover did the
Lions
recover no time came off the clock for
starters don't say it's a Music
[Applause]
City that's Nashville actually a Motown
miracle I knew like there moton Miracle
possibly Lions think they have it oh God
this is crazy Lions think they have it
Go might have a couple of throws to the
end zone with a depleted secondary back
there is the last line of defense
Buffalo did touch this ball first so
whoever has it it's going to be legal oh
Buffalo's going to close it out but not
yet not yet Dawson Knox thinks it
so bills are all there it is Buffalo
recovery
90
points almost 1100 yard of
offense Josh Allen came in as the MVP
favorite did he do enough here you think
in this Arena against this opponent had
lost only once he's beaten out the Lions
who had only one loss and he beat the
Chiefs who had no losses coming in did
he lock up the MVP today you think by
the way saquon Barkley had 61 yards and
the Eagles win with no touchdowns",""

rarely do I ask for favors
Now I'm knocking on your door
with hopes to save a friendship
with one who's a prisoner
far from home
Odysseus
Divine Intervention?
Is that what you seek?
To untie apprehensions that
were placed on that Greek?
You are playing with thunder
for a man full of shame
But if he's worth the risk
of going under
Why not make it a game?
Convince each of them that
he ought to be released,
and I'll release him
Who's ""them""?
Apollo!
Hephaestus!
Aphrodite!
Ares!
Hera!
Or me
What do you say?
- Great
- Very well
- Eh
- Alright!
Groovy
Bring it
(Apollo)
You all know I'm a fan
of catchy songs
So, with so many sirens gone,
I think Ody's in the wrong
They were trying to do him worse,
all he did was reimburse them
Now they'll tread with caution first
to live another day
and sing another verse
If that's true, release him
(Hephaestus)
Trust is not given, it's forged
Why should I give
him my support?
He sacrificed his own cohort
Did you forget they failed to listen?
He was betrayed
and then imprisoned
But if you make
the right decision
he can still build a future
with those who miss him
Fine, release him
(Aphrodite)
Your little high and mighty Odysseus
claims to love his mother,
but let her die of a broken heart
He was busy fighting!
More like busy spiting the cyclops
Let him feel the pain
that his mother felt and rot
Wait!
Please reconsider this
Really, Athena?
These old tricks?
Ares!
(Ares)
(Ares)
What kind of sick coward
holds back his power
while his friends get devoured?
He didn't even fight Scylla,
didn't even try to kill her!
Hides inside a wooden horse
to get the job done!
Never handles things upfront!
Pathetic and weak like his son!
Hold your tongue now!
His son's my friend!
And tell your lover that
a broken heart can mend!
You want more bloodshed?
Then set him free!
To get back to his homestead,
he'll make everybody bleed!
Ugh, release him
Hey, baby
(Hera!)
So many heroes!
So many tales!
Give me one good reason
why yours should prevail
- He's got the mind of a genius
- Try harder
- He's pretty skilled with words
- You can do better than that
- He's kind of funny?
- Eh
Never once has he cheated
on his wife
Release him
I've played your game and won
Release him
You dare to defy me?
To make me feel shame?
No one beats me,
no one wins my game!
Thunder, bring her through the wringer!
Show her I'm the judgment call,
the one who makes her kingdom fall!
Is she dead?
Let him go, please
Let him go",""

ABOUT THE GAME: 


Off road Outlaws gives you what you want in an off-road game: Complete control over how you build, setup, and drive your rig, tons of challenges to complete, and multiplayer so you can explore the trails on the open-world maps with your friends.


CONTROL
You build your rig the way you want it. You have total control over chassis setup - stiffness, damping, travel, etc... and can even swap to a different type of suspension if you want (want a modern truck with an I-Beam setup in front, and a solid axle in back? No problem.) For vehicle control, you're given Tilt, Arrow, or on-screen Steering wheel controls. You choose!


DRIVE
With several open world maps to choose from you can drive your rig slow across challenging rock routes, or fast over the flat sands of the desert. Want to take a break from the trails? Go play in the stunt park where you can use the ramps to ""test"" your rig's durability, or test your drivings skills in the Rock Park.","Venzogaming","#motocross, Motor Dirt Bikes Extreme Off_Road #1, android gameplay, all bikes, motor dirt bikes 2024, best bike motor game, free android, apk, download, 3d, kids, tractor, bike moto offroad, extreme, xtreme moto, best youtube bike video game","20","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing_video_game, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_culture","2023-06-08T10:01:00Z","PT12M59S","2004240","47",false,,""

Stickman Party is a collection of singleplayer / local multiplayer games, including games for one player, 2 player games, 3, or even as many as 4 players on the same device (smartphone of tablet). In stickman games, the rules are very simple. You can play without internet / Wi-Fi, because this game is for offline, local multiplayer, on one.

These fun stickman party games for one, two players or more are perfect on the road, for parties, first dates, as well as for husband and wife, children and parents, brother and sister, for a group of friends.

At Stickman Party, playing on the same device with friends is a lot of fun. The more people playing together, the more fun, but if you have no one around to play with, you can also play alone for one player, to train your skills for your later victories when you play with your friends.

Part of the games in the Party Stickman collection with unique rules, but there are also remakes of famous mobile hits. Of course, they are adapted to the crazy task, so that it would be comfortable to play one, for two, three and 4 players on one screen. For example:

‚Ä¢ Stickman Run for 1,2,3,4 player
‚Ä¢ Multiplayer Tanks
‚Ä¢ Football (soccer)
‚Ä¢ Micro car rally racing
‚Ä¢ Stickman clash
‚Ä¢ bounce the ball

One of the best ways to learn about game design is to just play a whole bunch of games. But with thousands of titles to choose from... where do you start? Well, this video lists 100 games that have most helped me in my journey to understand game development - from arcade classics to virtual reality thrills. 

=== Corrections ===

Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare was developed by Infinity Ward, not Treyarch.

Spaceteam is actually still on the iOS App Store!

has operated on a pretty simple principle:
that one of the best ways to learn about game¬†
design is to just play a bunch of video games.
Games can introduce us to¬†
new mechanics and systems.
They can teach us about fundamental game design¬†¬†
concepts like feedback loops¬†
and input and output randomness.
And games can act as a handy reference point when¬†
discussing game ideas with other game designers.
But there are a lot of video games out there.
Across more than fifty years of video¬†
game history, there have been hundreds¬†¬†
of thousands of video games across different¬†
genres and eras and platforms and styles.
And so if you were going to play some¬†
games to learn about game design,¬†¬†
it can be tricky to know where to start.
And so that's what this video is all about.
I've picked the 100 games that most helped¬†
me on my journey to understand game design.
These are the games that levelled up my game¬†¬†
design literacy, and opened my¬†
eyes to what this medium can do.
And so this is not a list of the 100¬†
greatest games ever made - though¬†¬†
I would recommend pretty much¬†
all of the games on this list.
And it's not a list of the 100¬†
most important or influential¬†¬†
games ever made - though you will pick¬†
up some history lessons along the way.
Instead, it's a list of the 100 games that¬†
most helped me to learn about game design.
Which is to say, this is unapologetically my list.
While I got some outside help¬†
to narrow down the candidates,¬†¬†
the final list of games is all me - to reflect¬†
the games that most helped me on my journey.
So this list is missing entire¬†
genres and massive franchises.
And there are two Zelda games on this¬†
list, and that was me showing restraint.
For each game, I'll try to focus on just one¬†
aspect that I think makes it worth playing,¬†¬†
but you'll need to play the game¬†
for yourself to get the full effect.
To that point, I've noted where¬†¬†
the game is available to buy digitally¬†
on PC, Xbox, PlayStation, or Switch.
But sadly, due to the sorry¬†
state of video game preservation,¬†¬†
some older titles are just¬†
impossible to get digitally.
So in those instances, you'll either have to do¬†¬†
the legwork to seek out a physical copy¬†
of the game and maybe an old console,¬†¬†
or use the alternatives I suggest¬†
to play something somewhat similar.
With all that being said, let's jump in.
I'm Mark Brown, and this is the 100¬†
games that taught me about game design.
Space Invaders was arguably the first game with¬†¬†
the sort of difficulty curve¬†
that we'd recognise today.
It was partly a quirk of engineering.
As you shoot aliens and remove them from¬†
the battlefield, the machine‚Äôs primitive¬†¬†
processor had one fewer sprite to draw and¬†
so the whole game runs a little quicker.
Every invader you swat, the faster¬†
- and harder - the game becomes.
But also, each level was intentionally¬†
designed to be a little more difficult¬†¬†
than the one before, as enemies start¬†
closer to the bottom of the screen.
Together, these create that wonderful spiky¬†
difficulty curve where the game is gradually¬†¬†
getting harder and harder, but things¬†
do ease off when you start a new level.
This undulating staircase provides rising tension‚Ä¶¬†¬†
but also moments of relief in¬†
which to catch your breath.
It‚Äôs essentially the exact same¬†
difficulty curve that‚Äôs used in¬†¬†
games today - making it an effective¬†
way to start learning about the topic.
You can play Space Invaders in your browser¬†
through the link in the description.
Also check out Space Invaders Extreme on Steam,¬†¬†
which reimagines the game as a neon-dipped¬†
score-chaser with a thumping techno soundtrack.
One of my favourite things about Pac-Man is the¬†¬†
way the game swings between¬†
two very different states.
By default, the game is about fear.
As you try to clear all the pellets in the maze,¬†
you are chased around by four meddlesome ghosts¬†¬†
who follow your every move, and seem to be able to¬†
work together to pin you down and catch you out.
But then you grab the power pellet.
And for a brief moment, the¬†
tables are drastically turned.
Now you are the predator,¬†
and the ghosts are the prey.
They run away from Pac-Man, and if¬†
you touch a ghost you‚Äôll earn points,¬†¬†
and temporarily remove it from play.
It is a satisfying reversal of roles that¬†
feels wonderful every time you pull it off.
And it also keeps the game varied and engaging¬†
- Pac-Man is not a one-note game about a single¬†¬†
emotion, but a dramatic back-and-forth¬†
tussle between power and powerlessness.
Pac-Man can be played in your browser, and there¬†
are ports on Steam and other major platforms.
You might also want to check¬†
out the semi-official sequel Ms.
Pac-Man, and the addictive, modern¬†
reimagining Pac-Man: Championship Edition.
With there being only a few years between the¬†
launch of Dungeons & Dragons and home computers,¬†¬†
it‚Äôs not surprising that a lot of early¬†
PC games were basically computerised D&D,¬†¬†
with the machine taking on the¬†
role of a digital dungeon master.
But one game stood out more than the rest: Rogue.
Designers Michael Toy and Glenn Wichman¬†
wanted to make an RPG that would feel¬†¬†
completely different each time you play, so hit¬†
upon the idea of using procedural generation.
Now the dungeon layouts are randomly¬†
cobbled together by a computer,¬†¬†
which is following certain rules for how to¬†
place down rooms, corridors, loot, and enemies.
They also didn‚Äôt want a way for players to¬†
simply learn the dungeon through rote repetition,¬†¬†
and so hit upon another idea that would come¬†
to define a genre: when you die, you die.
No check points, save states, or respawns.
It‚Äôs back to the very beginning¬†
and on to an entirely new dungeon.
Now I'll admit - I didn't play Rogue as a kid.
But it's been so influential on the games¬†
I play today that I just had to include it.
We'll have to wait until much later in the list¬†
to see these ideas truly come into their own.
You can play Rogue in your browser, or on Steam.
It took a surprisingly long time for game¬†
developers to think of letting a character jump.
It took even longer to make that jump feel fun.
Consider Mario‚Äôs first game: Donkey¬†
Kong, in which Mario has three,¬†¬†
predictably preprogrammed¬†
jumps - up, left, and right.
But by Super Mario Bros., Mario has, well,¬†
essentially an infinite number of jumps.
That‚Äôs because the height is determined¬†
by how long you hold the button.
Because the distance is driven by how fast¬†
Mario is running before you leave the ground.
And because you can even influence¬†
the plumber‚Äôs mid-air movement.
By having a jump that is driven¬†
by the push-and-pull of physics,¬†¬†
gravity, and player input, the simple act¬†
of leaping around is made incredibly fun,¬†¬†
expressive, and challenging - a mechanic¬†
that could sustain an entire game.
Or indeed, an entire genre of games.
Mario‚Äôs platforming has certainly¬†
improved in later games.
The physics were tweaked and¬†
perfected in Super Mario Bros. 3.
They were perfectly reimagined¬†
in 3D in Super Mario 64.
And new moves like the spin, ground pound,¬†¬†
wall jump, long jump, and hat throw¬†
add even more expressive action.
But Super Mario Bros. is still worthy of study¬†¬†
for its ambitious first stab¬†
at a proper video game jump.
Super Mario Bros. is available as part of¬†
the NES library on the Switch Online service.
While Shigeru Miyamoto and co. were¬†
finishing up Super Mario Bros.,¬†¬†
they were simultaneously working on¬†
another game that would, you know,¬†¬†
kick off a 40 year franchise and change¬†
the course of video game history.
What‚Äôs your side hustle, huh?
That game was, of course, The Legend of Zelda.
An adventurous fantasy epic, designed to emulate¬†¬†
Miyamoto‚Äôs childhood memories of¬†
exploring the Japanese countryside.
And it did this by giving the¬†
player a huge amount of freedom.
You‚Äôre dropped into a forest clearing¬†
and told to, essentially get on with it.
Your goal is to find eight pieces of a giant¬†¬†
golden triangle but how you¬†
do this is largely up to you.
You can now go in any direction,¬†¬†
explore where you like, and take on¬†
challenges in any order you see fit.
Sure, there are some obstacles that can‚Äôt be¬†
overcome until you find certain power-ups.
Many areas are filled with tough baddies who¬†
will flatten an inexperienced adventurer.
And the eight underground¬†
dungeons are technically numbered.
But still: Zelda 1 gives a remarkable¬†
amount of freedom to players.
And this makes your journey through¬†
the game feel personal and special.
It‚Äôs driven by curiosity, rather¬†
than a designer‚Äôs leading hand.
You can get it on the Switch Online service.
After the success of Super Mario Bros.,¬†
platformers fell into a predictable formula:¬†¬†
a series of levels, split into a series of worlds,¬†
played in whatever order the designer intended.
But Capcom shook that idea up with Mega Man.
This game begins on a stage select screen,¬†¬†
with six buttons that take you to the¬†
lairs of six different robot masters.
And you can take these dudes¬†
on in any order you like.
This gives the player a greater sense of freedom,¬†¬†
and encourages replay-ability as the game¬†
will feel subtly different each time you play.
But it‚Äôs more than just picking the order.
Every time you defeat a robot master¬†
you‚Äôll take on one of their powers.
And those powers will prove helpful in¬†
other levels and against other bosses.
For instance, you can defeat Guts¬†
Man to unlock a rock-chucking super¬†¬†
arm - which will destroy Cut Man in a couple hits.
Rock beats scissors, after all.
Now I don‚Äôt think the idea is¬†
perfect - it didn‚Äôt take long¬†¬†
for magazines to start sharing the¬†
optimum route through the game -
but it was a start, and is absolutely¬†
still the go-to cultural touchstone¬†¬†
for a game where you pick your¬†
own order to undergo challenges.
Mega Man can be played as part of¬†
the Mega Man Legacy Collection,¬†¬†
which contains all six original NES games.
Tetris is the perfect game.
I don‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs the best¬†
game ever made, or anything.
But I mean it feels like a complete,¬†
pure specimen - like a natural¬†¬†
property of the universe that was¬†
discovered, rather than designed.
Like a Rubik‚Äôs cube, a chess¬†
board, or Ryan Gosling.
But the aspect I want to focus on is the¬†
interesting way it handles difficulty.
Because as the game goes on - with¬†
you manically trying to drop blocks¬†¬†
into perfect lines - the game ramps up¬†
the challenge in two different ways.
The first way is that the speed increases¬†
after you clear a certain number of lines.
This is a sort of ‚Äòartificial difficulty‚Äô¬†
- the designer essentially reaching in¬†¬†
and tweaking the numbers to make your life harder.
But the second way is what you¬†
might call ‚Äòdiegetic difficulty‚Äô.
Basically: the more blocks there are on screen,¬†¬†
the less time it takes for new blocks¬†
to fall, and the harder it is to play.
The game becomes more difficult, as¬†
a natural outcome of the play space.
It arises from the rules of the¬†
game‚Äôs universe - hence, diegetic.
You can see a similar thing in a game like Snake,¬†¬†
where the longer your body grows, the¬†
harder it is to avoid crashing into it.
It‚Äôs an elegant way to make a game more difficult¬†¬†
in a way that is clearly visible¬†
and immediately understandable.
You can play Tetris in your browser.
But you might as well play the beautiful¬†
modern reimagining, Tetris Effect.
There‚Äôs so much you could say about¬†
the influence and importance of Doom.
It was a pioneer in 3D graphics, online¬†
deathmatch, shareware, cheat codes,¬†¬†
community-driven map-making, and it was¬†
so formative for the first person shooter¬†¬†
genre that similar games were all called¬†
""Doom-clones"" for about half a decade.
But this isn‚Äôt supposed to be a history lesson.
And, luckily, Doom is more than¬†
a stuffy old historical artefact.
In fact - it‚Äôs still wildly fun to play in 2024.
And that‚Äôs because - among other¬†
reasons - the game is fast.
Doomguy whips around the environment like¬†
the dude‚Äôs on rocket powered roller-skates.
Where many modern shooters feature¬†
flat-footed characters who run out¬†¬†
stamina while jogging towards cover points,¬†¬†
Doom‚Äôs protagonist is lighting quick, which¬†
makes encounters feel frenetic and fast-paced.
And that plays perfectly with the enemies,¬†
who all play with space and position.
Like the biting pinky - you‚Äôll want to¬†
keep a lot of space between you and them.
Or the imp‚Äôs meandering fireball projectiles,¬†
which can be dodged with fancy footwork.
There‚Äôs so much to learn from Doom.
But at the end of the day,¬†
it‚Äôs just a really fun game.
It‚Äôs available on Steam and the major consoles.
With the Metroid franchise - which really found¬†
its footing in 1994‚Äôs Super Metroid - Nintendo¬†¬†
stumbled upon a powerfully potent gameplay loop:¬†
one that centres on the joy of exploration.
The game takes place on the planet Zebes - which¬†
is not split up into distinct levels or worlds.
Instead, it‚Äôs a single, contiguous¬†
play-space - a non-linear,¬†¬†
interconnected ant farm of¬†
corridors and elevators.
Then again, your travel is often impeded by¬†
obstacles like doors that require special¬†¬†
missiles or superheated rooms that will burn¬†
you alive if you stick around for too long.
So‚Ä¶ go explore elsewhere, and hopefully you‚Äôll¬†
find a new power-up: maybe some missiles,¬†¬†
or hi-jump boots, a grapple beam, an ice beam,¬†
or an insulated suit that can withstand heat.
Now you can travel back to¬†
that obstacle and overcome it.
That might reward you with a handy upgrade.
Or it might reveal the next chunk of the map.
So through this repeating loop of explore¬†
and unlock, Super Metroid is all about using¬†¬†
exploration, and your memory of the world map,¬†
to slowly unpick a giant knot of locks and keys.
Until you find your way to the final boss.
It is a wonderfully satisfying formula that has¬†¬†
sustained an entire genre of¬†
so-called Metroidvania games -
from PS1 favourite Symphony of the Night,¬†
to modern indie gems like Hollow Knight.
Super Metroid is available¬†
on the Switch Online service.
For some of the older games on this¬†
list, you might have to cast your¬†¬†
mind back to the 80s or 90s to truly¬†
understand what made them so special.
But for Pokemon Blue, it would be very helpful¬†
if you could actually time travel back to 1996.
Because, sure, Pokemon is a cute¬†
little RPG in its own right.
It‚Äôs a game about catching¬†
monsters, training them up,¬†¬†
teaching them moves, and then doing¬†
battle with other Pokemon trainers.
And you‚Äôll need to think about elemental¬†
pair-ups, as grass-type monsters will¬†¬†
mop the floor with water-types, but get¬†
burnt to a cinder by fire-based critters.
But what made Pokemon so special¬†
was the fact that you could trade¬†¬†
monsters from one Game Boy to¬†
another, using a link cable.
To encourage this, Pokemon was split¬†
into two games - Red and Blue - which¬†¬†
are almost identical except for a number¬†
of Pokemon that are exclusive to each game.
So if you want Vulpix or Electabuzz,¬†
you‚Äôll need a link cable.
Other Pokemon would only¬†
evolve after being traded.
And the starter Pokemon never¬†
show up again in your game,¬†¬†
so you‚Äôll need to beg your¬†
friend for their Bulbasaur.
Pokemon is an excellent example of¬†
building community around a game,¬†¬†
not just through competition, but through¬†
trading and helping each other out.
Pok√©mon Blue Version is sadly not easy to¬†
play today, but it‚Äôs also not recommended¬†¬†
you walk up to a 10 year old and ask¬†
if they want to see your Geodude.
So maybe check out a more recent¬†
version and use your imagination¬†¬†
for what it would be like to trade¬†
these things on the school playground.
In my mind, two games really defined the jump to¬†
fully 3D gameplay: Super Mario 64 and Tomb Raider.
And both were about jumping around tricky¬†
three-dimensional obstacle courses.
But, then again, they worked¬†
in very different ways.
Mario is all about fluidity,¬†
speed, and bouncy trampoline jumps.
Whereas Tomb Raider is about¬†
positioning, patience, and precision.
Making your way through these ancient ruins is¬†¬†
almost like navigating a submarine¬†
or setting up an elaborate machine.
You must observe the environment and execute¬†
moves perfectly to get Lara Croft from A to B.
Today, in a world of games where characters¬†
magnetically snap to ledges and automatically¬†¬†
clamber up walls, this sort of precise¬†
movement can feel antiquated and frustrating.
But once you get into it, and feel the¬†
satisfaction of overcoming a bunch of obstacles,¬†¬†
you realise that there‚Äôs something to be¬†
gained by making movement more involved.
Tomb Raider can be played on all platforms,¬†¬†
as part of a remaster that¬†
features all three PS1 games.
You can press a single button to revert¬†
the game back to its original style.
Resident Evil was certainly not¬†
the first survival horror game.
In fact, many of its ideas were inspired by¬†¬†
Alone in the Dark - including the¬†
iconic fixed camera perspective.
But, hey, one game led to a thriving franchise¬†¬†
of critically acclaimed games and¬†
the other led to an Uwe Boll movie.
So, here we are.
There are plenty of ways that Resident Evil¬†
made players feel scared and unsettled.
From the aforementioned camera¬†
angle, to the clunky movement,¬†¬†
to good ol‚Äô fashioned jump scares.
But the one I want to point¬†
out is the way Resident Evil¬†¬†
simply restricts how much stuff you can have.
Key items like ammunition¬†
and healing herbs are rare,¬†¬†
which means you can‚Äôt blast¬†
your gun at anything that moves.
Instead you need to carefully conserve ammo,¬†¬†
consider every shot, and sometimes¬†
choose to just run away from enemies.
And then there‚Äôs the inventory¬†
- a tiny cramped grid.
Instead of carrying about an¬†
entire arsenal of different guns,¬†¬†
you have to think carefully about¬†
what items you need right now.
It's a perfect lesson in how a designer¬†
can make a player feel empowered,¬†¬†
or disempowered, simply by turning¬†
the big dial labelled ""resources"".
Resident Evil is hard to play outside¬†
of using original hardware in 2024,¬†¬†
so feel free to check out the impressive HD¬†
remake which is available on all major platforms.
Valve‚Äôs Half-Life tells a complete story‚Ä¶¬†
but without ever stopping for a cutscene.
The game follows Gordon Freeman - a nerdy¬†
scientist who gets caught up in an alien invasion.
He‚Äôll have to fight monsters, solve¬†
puzzles, fend off the military,¬†¬†
and even spend a bit of time on¬†
the aliens‚Äô home planet of Xen.
But the game‚Äôs narrative innovation is that this¬†
whole thing takes place from Gordon‚Äôs perspective.
And in real-time - without breaks,¬†
level transitions, or cutscenes.
This gives the game an immersive¬†
and grounded feel which operates¬†¬†
on the strengths of video games - rather¬†
than simply copying what works in movies.
So when characters talk to you -¬†
they look directly into the camera.
When explosions happen, they feel more impactful¬†
because they‚Äôre happening in real time.
And the game never takes away¬†
your control or sense of agency.
This might feel a little trite, seeing as a lot¬†¬†
of first-person shooter games now¬†
feature flashy cinematic set-pieces.
But it all goes back to Half-Life, and that¬†
slow tram ride into the heart of Black Mesa.
The game‚Äôs on Steam.
And, obviously, play Half-Life 2 as well.
Thief: The Dark Project follows¬†
burglar Garrett into mansions,¬†¬†
cathedrals, and any other place¬†
that might hide valuable treasure.
And because Garrett is not much of a fighter,¬†¬†
you‚Äôll need to focus on sneaking past¬†
enemies if you want to get back out alive.
This means reading the environment,¬†
and using it to your advantage.
And that operates on two axes.
You‚Äôve got light - you‚Äôll be spotted in¬†
bright areas, so stick to the shadows.
And sound - echoey surfaces¬†
can give your footsteps away,¬†¬†
so walk on grass and carpet where possible.
This makes for a game about patient¬†
observation, where you look, listen,¬†¬†
and try to figure out what¬†
the guards are thinking.
But you can also manipulate the environment to¬†
your own needs - perhaps using a water arrow to¬†¬†
douse a torch, or a moss arrow to create¬†
an impromptu rug to hush your footsteps.
Thief: The Dark Project is¬†
available on Steam as Thief Gold.
I think there‚Äôs a lot to learn¬†
about game design from the arcade.
These games can‚Äôt rely on complex stories,¬†
long campaigns, or in-depth gameplay.
They need to hook you immediately,¬†
explain their gameplay in seconds,¬†¬†
and incentivise you to come back and try¬†
again when you‚Äôve got more pocket money.
All good lessons for game¬†
designers to have up their sleeve.
Take Crazy Taxi - Sega‚Äôs¬†
bonkers driving game from 1999.
The game has you zig-zagging¬†
around a San Francisco-style city,¬†¬†
trying to make as many taxi journeys¬†
as possible within a matter of minutes.
So you pick up passengers, and then¬†
speed them to their destination.
The faster you get them there,¬†
the more money you earn.
But you can also get a bigger¬†
tip by pulling off stunts,¬†¬†
tricks, and driving recklessly along the way.
And then time‚Äôs up, and the game‚Äôs over.
Producer Kenji Kanno says ""the whole point of the¬†¬†
game is to have a lot of fun in a short¬†
period of time"", and I totally agree.
It‚Äôs my go-to example of a game with an extremely¬†
simple, but utterly concentrated, gameplay loop.
Crazy Taxi is available on¬†
Steam, but this version is¬†¬†
sadly missing the product placement¬†
and the iconic original soundtrack.
So Thief was part of a legacy of immersive sims.
These were games that used¬†
complex systems - like physics¬†¬†
and artificial intelligence - to simulate a world.
And would then immerse you in that world,¬†¬†
through a first person perspective,¬†
and realistic interactions.
So‚Ä¶ simulations that were¬†
immersive - hence, ‚Äòimmersive sim‚Äô.
But in 2000, designer Warren Spector and¬†
his team added a while new side to the term.
In Deus Ex - a globe-trotting cyberpunk spy¬†
thriller about conspiracies - the idea is that¬†¬†
the player is able to tackle objectives¬†
in just about whatever way they want.
So you can play the game as a first¬†
person shooter, like Half-Life.
Or you can take the stealthy approach and¬†
sneak around in the shadows, like Thief.
You can play it more like an adventure game,¬†¬†
as you chat to characters and¬†
negotiate for information.
Or you can treat it like an RPG, as¬†
you level up skills in lock-picking,¬†¬†
hacking, swimming, and so¬†
on, to unlock more routes.
All of this led to a game of¬†
overwhelming player freedom.
A game where levels are open-ended playspaces with¬†¬†
endless routes and solutions - and it‚Äôs¬†
up to the player to direct the action.
According to Spector, ""the game had to be¬†
about how clever and creative players were,¬†¬†
not how clever and creative¬†
we, as developers, were"".
Deus Ex has inspired a litany of¬†
fantastic games - like Dishonored¬†¬†
and Prey - that also work to empower the player.
But the incredible original¬†
is still available on Steam.
If you‚Äôre looking for someone to blame for the¬†
skill trees that show up in every modern game,¬†¬†
look no further than Blizzard‚Äôs Diablo II.
This game is a highly concentrated RPG which¬†
puts the focus almost exclusively on combat,¬†¬†
and on powering up your character.
Every time you get enough experience points¬†
to level up, you don‚Äôt just have a chance to¬†¬†
boost your stats like attack and dexterity - but¬†
you also get to choose a node on a skill tree.
Each one of these is a handy new ability¬†
- either a move you perform actively,¬†¬†
or a passive buff that‚Äôs¬†
helping in the background.
And each new skill can dramatically¬†
change how your character works.
Like, the Necromancer starts out with the¬†
ability to turn a dead body into a friendly¬†¬†
skeleton buddy, but 5 or so hours later you‚Äôll¬†
have a whole army of skeletons, a clay golem,¬†¬†
and an undead mage working alongside you, while¬†
you rip apart your enemies with powerful spells.
And it‚Äôs this feeling - going from powerless rube¬†¬†
to overpowered god - that makes Diablo¬†
II so fun, and so hard to put down.
You want to see the effect of just one more skill.
You want to get just a little more powerful.
Being able to see the whole skill tree is also¬†
hugely important: much of your time is spent¬†¬†
simply reading what later upgrades will do and¬†
dreaming of the time you‚Äôll finally unlock it.
The original Diablo II is available on Battle.net,¬†¬†
but requires a little jiggery pokery¬†
to get working on modern machines.
So feel free to play the remastered¬†
version if you want an easy life.
After the success of SimCity - a city-building¬†
simulation game about urban planning - designer¬†¬†
Will Wright decided to zoom in, and¬†
make a game about individual households.
And he called it The Sims.
So we ended up with a game that follows the lives¬†
of a user-created family of digitised humans.
And the game acts like an ant farm - you can¬†
just watch these people go about their day,¬†¬†
using smart utility AI to autonomously¬†
fulfil their needs and desires.
Or you can reach in and exert control.
For some players, The Sims¬†
was about telling stories,¬†¬†
and using the simulation¬†
gameplay as a means for creation.
For others, The Sims was about playing¬†
god - putting the sims in strange and¬†¬†
uncomfortable situations, or torturing¬†
them with a capricious flick of the mouse.
Pretty much everyone who has played The Sims¬†¬†
has sent a sim into the swimming¬†
pool‚Ä¶ and then deleted the ladder.
But this was the joy of The Sims¬†
- it was whatever you made of it.
20 years later, The Sims still remains an¬†
essential touchstone for player-led game design.
The original game can be found¬†
on abandonware websites - but¬†¬†
the very good The Sims 3 is available¬†
more easily on Steam, if you prefer.
Grand Theft Auto III and its sequels might be best¬†
known for their many, many media controversies.
But when it comes to game design, GTA is best know¬†
for popularising the idea of an open world game.
Pretty much every game that¬†
takes place in a giant,¬†¬†
contiguous city has to pay a debt of¬†
influence to Rockstar and Liberty City.
But GTA actually does something that¬†
most open world games still get wrong.
You see, the game has missions - which¬†
are carefully scripted levels with goals,¬†¬†
cutscenes, fail states, and rewards.
And doing these will advance the¬†
story and unlock more of the world.
But between those missions, the game encourages¬†
you to simply run riot, and let off steam.
You can drive off ramps to do stunts.
Steal an ambulance and become a paramedic.
Or simply get into a ridiculous¬†
city-wide car chase with the police.
In other open world games, there‚Äôs either¬†
little of interest to do in the open world,¬†¬†
or the story and fantasy¬†
precludes you from causing chaos.
But by making you a criminal, and filling the¬†
city with opportunities for mischief and mayhem,¬†¬†
Grand Theft Auto allows for¬†
unadulterated sandbox thrills.
It‚Äôs sadly only available as the iffy,¬†
Definitive Edition, ‚Äòremaster‚Äô these days.
But you can get a surprisingly good¬†
version of GTA 3 on iOS and Android.
I sometimes like to talk about¬†
how games feel on the thumbs.
How the simple joy of interacting with a mouse or¬†
controller can feel deeply, inherently satisfying.
So whether that‚Äôs pulling off a¬†
flaming uppercut in Street Fighter,¬†¬†
snaking in Mario Kart DS,¬†
or bunnyhopping in Quake,¬†¬†
these kinaesthetic qualities can¬†
elevate a game to a higher level of fun.
For me, though nothing beats Tony Hawk‚Äôs¬†
Pro Skater 3, and other games in the series.
These anarchic, score-chasing skateboarding games¬†¬†
are filled with quirky little inputs¬†
that feel satisfying to pull off.
For one, there are the tricks, which you unleash¬†¬†
by pressing a button and a¬†
direction simultaneously.
Then there‚Äôs the manual which is achieved with¬†
a tasty up-down twitch of the analogue stick.
And then there‚Äôs the revert, which is¬†
achieved by slamming a shoulder button¬†¬†
at the exact moment your board¬†
hits the wood of a half pipe.
Do these tricks - and others, like grinds¬†
and board flips - in a continuous combo,¬†¬†
and you‚Äôll feel like a gaming god.
There are few games where I can boot¬†
them up - even after being away for¬†¬†
years - and just instantly¬†
slip back into the groove.
I can‚Äôt ride a skateboard for toffee in real life,¬†
but I‚Äôll never forget how to trick in Tony Hawk‚Äôs.
Sadly, the only games easily¬†
available as of now are in a¬†¬†
remake collection featuring the first two games.
So you‚Äôll have to make do with those if¬†
you‚Äôre not willing to do a little work.
Developer Fumito Ueda is fond of a game-making¬†
approach called ‚ÄòDesign by Subtraction‚Äô,¬†¬†
which is all about removing extraneous¬†
elements to get at the core of the game.
He was inspired by the French title Another¬†
World - a cinematic adventure that did away¬†¬†
with typical video game elements like the user¬†
interface, score system, health bar, and lives.
And it even got rid of dialogue.
Instead, it depicted the relationship between¬†
two characters entirely through actions.
If you‚Äôve played Ico, that¬†
probably sounds familiar.
The game is about escorting a princess through¬†
a castle filled with monsters - but you can‚Äôt¬†¬†
speak each other‚Äôs language, so have to¬†
rely on input and actions to get along.
You can hold Yorda‚Äôs hand, give her vague¬†
commands, and bat away enemies to keep her safe.
Your relationship grows throughout the game, but¬†
is cemented when she‚Äôs taken away for a while.
Yorda, after all, grants you the ability to¬†
save your game - wso hen she‚Äôs gone, there‚Äôs¬†¬†
no way to lock in your progress, and you‚Äôll¬†
have to do the whole next section in one go.
Ico showed me the power of saying¬†
and doing less - and I can see its¬†¬†
influence in so many games released since.
Sadly you‚Äôll have to seek out Ico¬†
on PS2 or PS3 to play it today.
Once you‚Äôve done that, though, make sure you¬†
play Ueda‚Äôs other games - the incredible Shadow¬†¬†
of the Colossus, and the - well,¬†
interesting The Last Guardian.
Tetsuya Mizuguchi is one of gaming‚Äôs¬†
most interesting designers because,¬†¬†
for much of his career, he‚Äôs focused on¬†
achieving one goal: syncing up music,¬†¬†
visuals, and gameplay to put players¬†
in a trance-like state of synesthesia.
Perhaps his most successful attempt is Rez¬†
- an on-rails shooter where blasting enemies¬†¬†
creates sound effects which dynamically¬†
synchronise with the background music.
Mizuguchi explains that ""the rhythms of play¬†
would always be synched, and play would feel good.
When we first made this work, it felt like magic.""
And it‚Äôs true! Rez is not a¬†
complex game by any means,¬†¬†
but there‚Äôs something truly¬†
meditative and engrossing about it.
Especially when you play it in the dark,¬†
with a good set of headphones on, and - if¬†¬†
you‚Äôre feeling spicy - the trance vibrator¬†
peripheral nestled somewhere on your person.
It‚Äôs perhaps even better in VR, so if you¬†
can‚Äôt track down the Dreamcast original,¬†¬†
check out Rez Infinite on your headset.
While the Resident Evil games focused on¬†
campy B-movie horror - all rubber suit¬†¬†
monsters and haunted houses - the Silent Hill¬†
games were going for something more‚Ä¶ cerebral.
Silent Hill 2, for instance,¬†¬†
focuses on psychological horror, that stems¬†
from the protagonist‚Äôs trauma and guilt.
This is achieved in many ways, but¬†
perhaps the most effective is in the¬†¬†
design of the titular town itself - Silent Hill.
Because the layout of this place,¬†
and the way you move through it,¬†¬†
can be more unsettling than¬†
any creature or monster.
This is achieved through long, quiet¬†
hallways that slowly build a sense of unease.
Through rooms that have scary noises,¬†¬†
but no actual monsters, which¬†
keeps you on edge at all times.
And through the dense fog that¬†
hangs over the whole town,¬†¬†
making it impossible to know what‚Äôs too far ahead.
But I think my favourite touch is the¬†
way the game deals with verticality.
There are sections where protagonist¬†
James Sunderland travels down - maybe¬†¬†
going down a staircase or jumping into a dark pit.
And then he goes down again. And again.
And at some point you realise: I¬†
shouldn‚Äôt be able to go down this deep.
That‚Äôs not how buildings work.
It defies logic and physics.
But then again, Silent Hill¬†
was never really logical,¬†¬†
because the town is ultimately a¬†
metaphor for James‚Äôs tortured mind.
And as the one running around¬†
this psychological space,¬†¬†
you‚Äôre right there with him,¬†
living through his trauma.
Spooky stuff!
Silent Hill 2 is unfortunately not¬†
available on any current platforms,¬†¬†
so you‚Äôll have to unearth a¬†
PlayStation 2 to play it today.
Right now we‚Äôre in the midst¬†
of a cozy game revolution.
Every other indie developer is making a¬†
comforting little game without combat,¬†¬†
time limits, fail states, or challenges.
But if there‚Äôs a patient zero for¬†
this viral outbreak in coziness,¬†¬†
it‚Äôs probably Animal Crossing.
This game casts you as a villager in a town¬†¬†
filled with animal critters and it¬†
leaves you to just‚Ä¶ live your life.
You can buy furniture for your house,¬†¬†
dig up fossils and catch fish, chat¬†
to your neighbours, and send letters.
The game is full of objectives¬†
and things to do but, crucially,¬†¬†
there‚Äôs no pressure to finish¬†
any of them anytime soon.
Because sure, it‚Äôs a familiar¬†
meme that Tom Nook is a ruthless¬†¬†
landlord who has trapped you in an¬†
infinite mortgage repayment scheme -
but find me a real-world bank that¬†
doesn‚Äôt mind if you never actually¬†¬†
pay off your home and I‚Äôll transfer¬†
my mortgage to them immediately.
Animal Crossing also works hard to¬†
force you into a leisurely pace.
You cannot binge through the game‚Äôs content¬†
as some stuff only happens once a day,¬†¬†
and shops open and close at specific hours.
Where some designers never want you to stop¬†
playing their game, Animal Crossing shows¬†¬†
that there‚Äôs real value in giving players¬†
a reason to switch off and touch grass.
Playing Animal Crossing will require you¬†
to dig out a Gamecube but, in all honesty,¬†¬†
you‚Äôll get a similar experience¬†
playing the latest version on Switch.
Making a game is hard.
Now imagine making 200 of them.
But that‚Äôs the idea behind WarioWare - a¬†
rapid-fire micro game collection where the¬†¬†
player needs to see, understand, and complete a¬†
microscopic video game in a matter of seconds.
That might involve directing¬†
a finger up a man‚Äôs nose,¬†¬†
catching a falling stick, or deploying an air bag.
Each game is a tiny weeny masterclass in design.
Because imagine making a video game where you have¬†
to communicate how to play in the blink of an eye.
So each micro game must express¬†
its idea through colour, shape,¬†¬†
composition, and a single-word prompt¬†
like ‚Äòbounce‚Äô, ‚Äòcatch‚Äô, or ‚Äòjump‚Äô.
But the real thrill is playing¬†
these things back to back,¬†¬†
as you must be ready to change¬†
your skills every 4 seconds.
You play WarioWare games in a heightened grip,¬†
ready to test your reactions and reflexes.
There‚Äôs almost nothing like WarioWare¬†
- outside of its many sequels.
But I think it‚Äôs a beautiful idea for a game,¬†¬†
and an excellent reference point for getting¬†
the most out of the absolute tiniest idea.
It‚Äôs available on Switch Online.
I wanted to include at least one game on this list¬†¬†
that fits into the category¬†
of serious game, or newsgame.
These are games that comment on serious,¬†¬†
political, or newsworthy topics - using¬†
game mechanics and systems to make a point.
September 12th is perhaps¬†
the most famous of the bunch.
The game features a middle eastern village that‚Äôs¬†¬†
occupied by both terrorists¬†
and innocent civilians.
The game asks you to drop bombs on the¬†
terrorists but it quickly becomes clear¬†¬†
that it‚Äôs impossible to attack them without¬†
accidentally killing civilians in the explosion.
What‚Äôs more, other villagers¬†
will mourn the dead and some¬†¬†
will be turned into terrorists themselves.
It‚Äôs up to the player to realise¬†
that nothing good can come of this¬†¬†
approach and the only way to win,¬†
so to speak, is to stop playing.
September 12th is the perfect example of how a¬†
game can be used to provoke thoughts and debate.
And a reminder that video games don‚Äôt have to be¬†¬†
fun - their interactivity can also¬†
be used to make a serious point.
You can play it in your browser.
Game design is inextricably linked to failure.
Unlike other forms of entertainment,¬†¬†
games are built around the idea that¬†
you can lose, fail, die, and screw up.
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time¬†
was one of the first games I played¬†¬†
that really explored this idea -¬†
both mechanically and narratively.
In terms of mechanically, the Prince has access¬†
to a magic hourglass that lets you rewind time,¬†¬†
so any mistakes made in the game‚Äôs tricky¬†
platforming challenges can be undone.
It‚Äôs perhaps only a slight twist¬†
on the typical checkpoint or save¬†¬†
state systems but it puts power into¬†
the player‚Äôs hands and makes fixing¬†¬†
your failures a precious resource¬†
that the player can spend or save.
But then there‚Äôs the narrative side.
The whole game is given a meta-textual¬†
twist as it‚Äôs actually a bedtime story,¬†¬†
told by the Prince himself.
And so any deaths are explained away as¬†
a simple mistake in the storytelling.
Now. Okay. I‚Äôm not sure how that actually works.
Imagine telling a story about your last¬†
holiday where you say ""and then I fell¬†¬†
into some spikes and died‚Ä¶ oh wait,¬†
hold on, that‚Äôs not what happened"".
But hey, it hung a lampshade on one of gaming‚Äôs¬†¬†
weirdest quirks in a way that¬†
I still reference to this day.
Sands of Time is on Steam.
Katamari Damacy is a charming and¬†
imaginative game... about garbage.
The game is about a pint-size prince¬†
who must roll up giant balls of garbage,¬†¬†
to recreate the stars and moons that¬†
his dad destroyed in a drunken bender.
So you start small - picking up¬†
staples, thumbtacks, and erasers.
Before moving on to picking up¬†
cars, elephants, and people.
And then buildings, bridges, and giant squid.
That constant power creep, that feeling¬†
of getting stronger and stronger,¬†¬†
is always fun in games - but¬†
now it‚Äôs visible and tactile.
It‚Äôs just joyful to start¬†
out small and end up big.
To look back and see how far you‚Äôve come.
Designer Keita Takahashi focused on¬†
four key pillars for the game - novelty,¬†¬†
ease of understanding, enjoyment, and humour.
And if you ask me, he nailed the lot of them.
Katamari Damacy is available on all¬†
platforms, as part of the REROLL remaster.
The humble scoring system, which showed up in most¬†
arcade games, fell out of favour by the mid 2000s.
It was deemed archaic, and - in a world of¬†
more cinematic games - kinda video-gamey.
Ew, gross.
But Devil May Cry 3 shows¬†
that, when used carefully,¬†¬†
a score can elevate a game and push¬†
players to truly engage with a piece.
So DMC features a complex combat system with¬†¬†
all sorts of different moves¬†
that require intricate inputs.
And these moves can be chained¬†
together for non-stop combos.
And you can even swap weapons mid-way¬†
through a combo to unleash even more attacks.
Which is‚Ä¶ a lot to ask of players! But¬†
you don‚Äôt need to know half of this stuff¬†¬†
to get through the game - you can simply¬†
fumble your way through most encounters.
But that‚Äôs where the scoring system comes in.
Your combat prowess is ranked based on how stylish¬†
you are - from Dope, all the way to SSStylish.
With three Ss.
To get the best grade, then, you‚Äôll need¬†
to show full understanding of the system¬†¬†
by performing the hardest moves, keeping your¬†
attacks varied, and never dropping your combo.
Devil May Cry 3 is best on PlayStation 2,¬†¬†
but you can also get it as part of the¬†
DMC HD Collection on all major platforms.
I could give a dozen reasons¬†
for playing Resident Evil 4.
But lemme stick to just one: the¬†
game‚Äôs perfect sense of pacing.
For the most part, Resident Evil 4 is¬†
a series of chaotic pitched battles.
Perhaps best seen in the game‚Äôs opening¬†
tussle in which Leon is trapped in a¬†¬†
tiny village filled with zombified farmhands.
And - oh yeah, a crazed dude with a sack¬†
on his head and a chainsaw in his hands.
This is a tense, no-holds barred encounter¬†
that will leave your palms sweaty.
But then it mixes things up.
A bit of downtime, perhaps, with puzzles to solve,¬†
or locations to scout, or items to scavenge.
Or a cutscene - a campy action-flick story beat.
Or maybe a bit of time shopping as you upgrade¬†
your items and rearrange your attache case.
Or maybe it‚Äôs a boss fight - an epic¬†
showdown with some ugly zombified nasty.
This is a masterclass in keeping the player¬†
engaged: as soon as one idea, enemy type, or¬†¬†
location starts to wear out its welcome, Resident¬†
Evil 4 changes things up and tries something new.
You never become bored or overstimulated.
Which makes it genuinely hard¬†
to put down the controller.
There‚Äôs so much else to¬†
love about Resident Evil 4.
But you‚Äôll have to play it¬†
yourself to truly appreciate it.
Start with the 2005 original, available on¬†
all major platforms - and then check out the¬†¬†
2023 remake to see how Capcom updated¬†
the game for today‚Äôs sensibilities.
When the Xbox 360 launched in late 2005,¬†
it came with a feature that would go on to¬†¬†
define a new type of game - and would change the¬†
fortunes of a handful of now famous developers.
Because if you got sick of¬†
such great launch titles as,¬†¬†
uhm, Amped 3 or, errr, NHL 2K6, you could
pop into the Xbox Live Arcade and download small,¬†¬†
cheap, time-waster games like Zuma, Bejeweled 2,¬†
and - my favourite - Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved.
This is a twin stick shooter, where¬†
the two analogue sticks take care of¬†¬†
moving around the screen,¬†
and blasting your enemies.
This allows for masterful¬†
movement through the environment.
You can run away from enemies, while¬†
still shooting in their direction.
And bobbing, weaving, and slicing¬†
through waves of enemies just feels good.
Of course, the twin stick genre¬†
wasn‚Äôt new - Geometry Wars is¬†¬†
basically just a pimped out version¬†
of Robotron: 2084 from the early 80s.
But what made Geometry Wars¬†
stand out was the presentation.
The polish. What we‚Äôd now call: juice
The game explodes with colour, and dead¬†
enemies erupt into messy particle fountains.
When you launch a bomb it¬†
literally warps the playfield,¬†¬†
which sells the impact of that explosion.
Pair it up with a thumping techno soundtrack and¬†
you can see why this‚Ä¶ had to give way to this‚Ä¶
Of course, there are many games¬†
to study if you want to learn¬†¬†
about juice - most notably the work of Vlambeer.
But Geometry Wars was the first¬†
game I played where I realised that¬†¬†
the presentation was sucking me in,¬†
just as much as the gameplay itself.
You can get Geometry Wars on Steam and Xbox.
Time limits are one of the most interesting -¬†
but challenging things to toy with in games.
Take Dead Rising. This zombie apocalypse¬†
game is built around a ticking clock.
You‚Äôve got to survive for 72 hours¬†
before a helicopter comes to pick you¬†¬†
up - and you can feel this time limit¬†
hanging over your head at all times.
So, you can‚Äôt just waste time¬†
endlessly killing zombies:¬†¬†
you need to get on and make¬†
a move with the main quest.
You also realise that you can‚Äôt¬†
save every NPC - each one will¬†¬†
be killed at the end of a timer, so¬†
unless you move at super sonic speed,¬†¬†
you‚Äôre going to have to pick and¬†
choose who you can lead to safety.
Getting better at the game means¬†
managing your time more efficiently.
And learning the layout of the game‚Äôs shopping¬†
mall so you can move more effectively.
So the time limit adds to the sensation¬†
of being in a fraught situation.
But‚Ä¶ it can also be a drag, and¬†
in every game with a time limit,¬†¬†
there are plenty of players who moan about it, or¬†
ask for it to be removed through a cheat or mod.
Therefore, I recommend you play Dead Rising and¬†¬†
decide for yourself - does the timer¬†
add to the experience, or detract?
Sometimes, the most polarising¬†
games are helpful in letting¬†¬†
you decide which side of the fence you fall on.
Dead Rising is available on¬†
Steam, Xbox, and PlayStation.
There‚Äôs a lot to say about Call of Duty 4.
The campaign is filled with great designs - like a¬†
training facility which will suggest a difficulty¬†¬†
level, based on how well you perform, and a tense¬†
stealth mission set in the Ukraine wilderness.
But also some stuff that‚Äôs‚Ä¶ perhaps fallen¬†
out of favour, like regenerating health,¬†¬†
highly scripted set-piece levels,¬†
and infinitely re-spawning enemies.
But the one aspect I‚Äôd like to point¬†
at is the perks system in multiplayer.
Call of Duty cleverly took¬†
aspects from RPG games - like¬†¬†
stats and level ups - and applied¬†
them to an online shooter.
So now, each battle you fight¬†
will earn you experience points¬†¬†
that can be spent on new guns, kill¬†
streak rewards, perks, and so on.
None of these give you an outright advantage¬†
over the enemy - each one has disadvantages¬†¬†
and counters - but they let you create a highly¬†
personalised load-out that fits your play style.
This gives the online multiplayer¬†
a true sense of progression.
Battles aren‚Äôt just fun throw-downs, but each¬†
one brings you a little closer to that cool perk,¬†¬†
or that handy laser sight that you can slap¬†
on top of your favourite assault rifle.
It made the online gameplay¬†
crazy compelling - in fact,¬†¬†
it‚Äôs so much fun that the top reward¬†
is the ability to ""prestige"" - i.e,¬†¬†
reset your level back to zero so you¬†
get the joy of unlocking it all again.
Call of Duty 4 is available on Steam,¬†
and other stores as a remaster.
But, in truth, you can play pretty much any¬†
Call of Duty game and get the same experience.
Portal has a lot of lessons for game designers.
Lessons about how games can tell¬†
jokes, purely through game mechanics.
How puzzles are designed.
How a small idea can be expanded into a full game.
How playtesting can be used.
And how, sometimes, less is more.
But the aspect I want to focus on here,¬†¬†
is how new game ideas can come around¬†
by mushing together disparate genres.
Because Portal is a puzzle game - all¬†
about making logical leaps and clever¬†¬†
connections - but you solve those puzzles¬†
with the tools of a first person shooter.
So you can run around in 3D space,¬†¬†
and you get a portal gun which you¬†
can aim and fire like a weapon.
This opens up interesting new puzzle avenues about¬†
careful aiming, and about movement and momentum.
It even introduces a little light combat - but¬†¬†
it‚Äôs more about outsmarting your¬†
enemies than fighting them head on.
It also makes the genre approachable to an¬†
audience that might not have considered puzzles.
By setting it in the Half-Life universe¬†
and giving you a, quote-unquote, gun,¬†¬†
Portal snuck its way into the¬†
hearts of FPS players, as well.
But there's one more aspect of Portal¬†
that makes it an essential teaching tool:¬†¬†
the developer's commentary, where Valve¬†
designers explain how they made the game.
Listening to this kicked off my obsession with¬†
learning about game design and, to be honest,¬†¬†
Game Maker's Toolkit probably wouldn't¬†
exist if I didn't stumble upon this feature.
Portal is on Steam and Switch.
Mass Effect - a sprawling sci-fi RPG from BioWare¬†
- is all about responding to the player‚Äôs choices.
You can change Shepard from a heroic¬†
Paragon to a selfish Renegade,¬†¬†
and start romantic relationships with¬†
one - or more - of your party members.
But the game also reacts to your choices¬†
by making significant changes to the plot.
For instance - at one point, you‚Äôll¬†
find that Krogan party member Wrex¬†¬†
is vehemently against your plan to¬†
destroy a Krogan breeding facility.
You might be able to talk him¬†
around and get him onside.
Or the conversation might end in a¬†
violent shoot-out that leaves Wrex dead.
He‚Äôs now permanently removed as a party member.
But what‚Äôs more - he won‚Äôt appear¬†
in Mass Effect 2 or 3, either.
Because, at the risk of spoiling the¬†
sanctity of this meaningless YouTube list,¬†¬†
you really need to play all three Mass¬†
Effect games to the get true impact.
Seeing how your decisions ripple out across¬†
three massive games is quite remarkable.
And while BioWare sadly couldn‚Äôt stick¬†
the ending in the third entry - though,¬†¬†
how could it satisfy every possible choice¬†
you‚Äôve made over 100 hours of gameplay? - it‚Äôs¬†¬†
still an amazing feat to allow players¬†
to have such unique and personal stories.
The Mass Effect games are available in a¬†
well-regarded remastered Legendary Edition on PC,¬†¬†
Xbox, and PlayStation, but you can also get¬†
the original games on Steam if you prefer.
Maybe it‚Äôs a little indulgent to talk¬†
about two skateboarding games on this list.
But I think it‚Äôs fascinating to see how Tony¬†¬†
Hawk‚Äôs and Skate approach the sport¬†
in two completely different ways.
Because where Tony Hawk‚Äôs is¬†
a bonkers score-chasing arcade¬†¬†
gem that ignores the rules of physics,¬†
Skate is more grounded and realistic.
One way it achieves this is with an¬†
innovative control scheme that makes you¬†¬†
mimic the action of kicking a skateboard,¬†
by wiggling the right analogue stick.
So, just like how you ollie in real¬†
life by pushing the board down,¬†¬†
and then kicking the lip back up, you jump in¬†
Skate by flicking the stick down, and then up.
More complex tricks come from more¬†
complicated inputs on the analogue stick.
It‚Äôs difficult - but that‚Äôs the point.
In Tony Hawk‚Äôs it‚Äôs hard to do a¬†
900 degree spin over a helicopter.
In Skate it‚Äôs hard to jump down a five step¬†
staircase without rupturing your spleen.
Playing both Tony Hawk‚Äôs and Skate¬†
is a fantastic lesson in how you¬†¬†
can tackle a topic from vastly different angles.
And it makes you wonder whether there are¬†
different ways to approach the other sports.
What if football games were less like¬†
FIFA, and more like Rocket League?
Skate is available on the Xbox store.
Multiplayer games are balanced around counters.
No matter what character,¬†
move, or strategy you pick,¬†¬†
the other player can respond with¬†
an option that will shut you down.
And in Team Fortress 2, that extends to a¬†
complex interlocking web of nine different¬†¬†
character classes, who all have strengths¬†
and weaknesses when fighting each other.
Like‚Ä¶ the engineer‚Äôs turrets¬†
are great at stopping scouts,¬†¬†
but the demoman‚Äôs grenades¬†
can quickly destroy a turret.
Then again, the speedy scout is¬†
perfect for downing the demoman.
And then the spy can sap the¬†
turret or backstab a sniper,¬†¬†
but the pyro‚Äôs flame can quickly¬†
disable a spy‚Äôs disguise.
And then the heavy‚Ä¶ well, you get the point.
This is rock, paper, scissors¬†
in four dimensions, people.
And so after nearly 20 years, Team¬†
Fortress 2 is still great fun,¬†¬†
and still a great example of how to keep a complex¬†
multiplayer game feeling balanced and fair.
You can get it on Steam, for free.
There‚Äôs so much to learn from BioShock.
But the one aspect I want to¬†
focus on here is the audio diary.
So this game takes place in Rapture -¬†
a striking underwater metropolis that¬†¬†
was supposed to be a utopia¬†
for the rich and intelligent.
But, as so often happens with these things,¬†¬†
it turned into a nightmare and now¬†
everyone is dead, or utterly deranged.
Which can make storytelling a little tricky.
So the designers of BioShock¬†
used a clever narrative device:¬†¬†
cassette tapes that were recorded¬†
during Rapture‚Äôs downfall - and¬†¬†
then left scattered about the¬†
city after everyone disappeared.
This way, the player is able to learn about the¬†¬†
world of Rapture by finding¬†
and listening to these logs.
It adds an archeological twist to¬†
proceedings as you feel like you‚Äôre¬†¬†
unearthing the past and piecing¬†
together the narrative yourself.
These logs can also tell side stories, flesh out¬†
character backgrounds, and explain bits of lore.
Now, BioShock didn‚Äôt invent the audio diary¬†
- they‚Äôre a mix of System Shock‚Äôs emails,¬†¬†
Metroid Prime‚Äôs scan logs, and¬†
Metal Gear Solid‚Äôs codec calls.
But BioShock‚Äôs implementation¬†
was perfect and inspired a huge¬†¬†
number of games to add in their own audio diaries.
And they led to games that told their¬†
story entirely through found objects.
But, we‚Äôll come back to that.
BioShock is available on Steam,¬†
and on consoles as a remaster.
Burnout was already a pretty perfect game.
It‚Äôs an arcade racer where the way to win¬†
is to literally crush the competition.
Smashing, squeezing, and splintering nearby¬†
cars doesn‚Äôt just put them out of the race for a¬†¬†
second, but nets you a nitrous boost that you can¬†
use to fling forward - and into your next target.
But Burnout Paradise then took the¬†
formula and plopped it into an open world.
Now, remember - this was back when such¬†
a prospect was a delight, not a threat.
And so what we get is a game that never stops.
You are always in your car, always¬†
racing, and always smashing.
You can just pull up to a stop sign and¬†
start a race - or you can simply bomb around,¬†¬†
break through signs, fly over¬†
jumps, or hunt down special cars.
Same goes for the social aspects.
Sure, you can pull in friends and¬†
do multiplayer races and events¬†¬†
but competition is simply weaved¬†
into the world thanks to a litany¬†¬†
of leaderboards - with each street noting¬†
the fastest sprint and the biggest crash.
And where many open world games pen you¬†
in during missions - with invisible walls¬†¬†
and frustrating fail states - Burnout Paradise¬†
does not: the whole world is always open to you.
And so when a race takes¬†
you from point A to point B,¬†¬†
you can take whichever route¬†
suits you to get there.
Burnout Paradise is on all¬†
platforms as a Remastered edition.
Far Cry 2 is all about friction.
Lemme list just some of the ways that this game¬†
works to frustrate and rub up against the player.
So: your weapons get rusty and¬†
can jam in the middle of combat.
You have malaria, and have to regularly¬†¬†
top up your medication so you¬†
don‚Äôt just fall over and die.
To look at the map you have to hold up a piece of¬†
paper - and the game doesn‚Äôt pause while doing so.
Wildfires can sweep away the dry grass¬†
you were planning to use for cover.
And so on, and so on.
A lot of game design is about¬†
endlessly playtesting a game¬†¬†
to remove elements that might¬†
be annoying or off-putting.
It‚Äôs about shaving off the jagged edges,¬†
providing ""quality of life"" features,¬†¬†
and secretly giving the player a helping hand.
But Far Cry 2 proves that the opposite can¬†
also lead to incredible gameplay experiences.
Playing this game truly feels like being¬†
a lone mercenary in a hostile country.
You feel outgunned,¬†
underpowered, scared, and alone.
Far Cry 2 is on Steam and Xbox.
It‚Äôs also well worth playing the later Far¬†
Cry games which are fun in their own right,¬†¬†
but are also opposite to Far¬†
Cry 2 is almost every way.
You‚Äôll learn a lot about design - and your¬†¬†
own preferences - by playing¬†
Far Cry 2 and 3 back to back.
Left 4 Dead pits a team of survivors¬†
against a team of distinct zombie¬†¬†
monsters - like a big fat bloke that¬†
explodes into a cloud of bile when shot.
Or a dude who can wrap you¬†
up in his snake-like tongue.
But perhaps the most interesting¬†
character of all, is one you never see.
Behind the scenes, ""The Director"" is an¬†
AI system that works to dynamically alter¬†¬†
the game‚Äôs pace, difficulty, and dramatic tension.
So, the director spawns in mobs of zombies,¬†
and places down special infected monsters.
But then it keeps track of each¬†
player‚Äôs level of intensity.
Is the player low of health? Being incapacitated¬†¬†
by a smoker? Or has just spent¬†
a lot of time shooting zombies?
When the intensity hits its peak, the director¬†
starts a relax phase where no zombies spawn.
And maybe secretly adds some pills¬†
and ammo to nearby pick-up areas, too.
And once it‚Äôs sure the players have caught their¬†
breath, it starts to build up the intensity again.
This innovative system works to keep¬†
the game interesting and engaging,¬†¬†
specifically by reacting to the¬†
player‚Äôs current state - proving¬†¬†
that difficulty and pace don‚Äôt have¬†
to be set once, before the game ships.
Instead, they can ebb and flow¬†
based on what the player is doing.
Left 4 Dead is available on Steam.
And so is Left 4 Dead 2, where the¬†
director gains the ability to change¬†¬†
entire chunks of level layout¬†
in response to player actions.
Remember when I talked about Rogue?¬†
Like seven hours ago? Well, in 2008,¬†¬†
designer Derek Yu had a super smart idea.
He realised that Rogue‚Äôs most important bits -¬†
the randomly generated levels and the punishing¬†¬†
permadeath - didn‚Äôt need to be in turn-based,¬†
tile-based games about crawling through dungeons.
And so in Spelunky, he put¬†
those ideas‚Ä¶ into a platfomer.
And, suddenly, we get a fresh¬†
new twist on a familiar genre.
Where a lot of platformers are about repeating¬†
the same level as you slowly learn the exact¬†¬†
right time to jump over each gap, Spelunky‚Äôs¬†
procedurally generated levels mean you can‚Äôt¬†¬†
rely on memory or repetition - you have¬†
to simply improve your baseline skills.
You need to get better at jumping, at dealing with¬†
enemies, at blowing up walls, and dropping ropes.
Spelunky would kick off a whole¬†
new era of roguelikes - inspiring¬†¬†
hundreds of games in all¬†
sorts of different genres.
And while each one holds¬†
interesting lessons - like,¬†¬†
should your progress persist from run to run?¬†
And how can you tell an interesting story in a¬†¬†
game that keeps resetting? - Spelunky is¬†
worth playing to see how things started.
And also because it‚Äôs just incredibly fun.
Spelunky Classic from 2008 is¬†
available for free - but you¬†¬†
might want to check out the excellent HD¬†
remake, which is on all major platforms.
Also read Derek Yu's book¬†
about the making of Spelunky,¬†¬†
which is an incredible resource¬†
for would-be game designers.
I talked a little bit about diegetic¬†
interfaces, when I mentioned Far Cry 2's map.
But the reigning king of this¬†
idea is definitely Dead Space.
This sci-fi horror game is all about immersion.
And it achieves this through a bunch of¬†
different ways - including its impeccable¬†¬†
sound design, and by never taking¬†
away your control for a cutscene.
But the most memorable feature is the¬†¬†
way the game displays its entire¬†
interface within the game world.
So Isaac Clark's health bar is a giant¬†
gauge on the back of his space suit.
His current ammo count is displayed on each gun.
The inventory, FaceTime camera, and¬†
shop screens are projected as holograms.
Dead Space will always be the go-to example¬†
of how to hide a HUD in the game itself.
Dead Space is on Steam and Xbox, and there's¬†
a fancy remake on everything bar Switch.
It became a meme - ""this game¬†
makes me feel like Batman"".
Basically every review parroted the same¬†
line, with the same sentiment - Batman:¬†¬†
Arkham Asylum actually let players¬†
fulfil the fantasy of being Batman.
But that is ultimately the¬†
game‚Äôs greatest strength.
Every decision in this game is pushing the¬†
player towards feeling like the dark knight.
Whether that‚Äôs in the free-flow combat system,¬†
where the game magnetically pulls Batman towards¬†¬†
nearby enemies and automatically¬†
pulls off cool finishing moves.
Or it‚Äôs in the stealth sections, where guards¬†
are told not to turn around or look up high,¬†¬†
so Batman can stalk his enemies like a panther.
There‚Äôs a reason why the Arkham games are now the¬†
go-to reference point for comic book games - it‚Äôs¬†¬†
the gold standard that Marvel and DC want to hit¬†
when making games based on other caped crusaders.
The game is available on Steam,¬†¬†
and on other platforms as part of¬†
the Arkham Collection or Trilogy.
One of the best ways to learn about a genre is¬†¬†
to seek out the most simple¬†
and succinct version of it.
A game that boils a complex set of systems¬†
and mechanics down to its absolute basics.
Take Plants vs. Zombies - a cute¬†
and casual tower defence game,¬†¬†
which is secretly a real-time strategy game.
But one that even an idiot like me can play.
So the game is about defending your¬†¬†
house from hordes of slow-moving¬†
zombies, by placing down plants.
Each plant has a specific role¬†
to play - from pea-shooting pods¬†¬†
to walnut barriers to plants¬†
that launch globs of butter.
And each zombie has its own role too - there¬†
are armoured zombies that can tank damage,¬†¬†
pole-vaulting zombies that can¬†
leap over your defences, and more.
And on top of this there‚Äôs an economy.
Sunflowers are perhaps the most¬†
important plant in the game,¬†¬†
as they generate the solar¬†
currency needed to buy more stuff.
So while it‚Äôs tempting to go fully on¬†
the offence, PvZ will teach you that¬†¬†
you need to balance your build between¬†
attack power and economic productivity.
So while it‚Äôs not a true RTS, Plants vs.
Zombies has a lot to teach about unit types, enemy¬†
differentiation, economy balancing, and more.
If you‚Äôre ever unsure about how a genre works,¬†¬†
find a game that boils it down to its¬†
absolute essentials and start there.
Plants vs. Zombies is available on Steam and Xbox.
You could argue that the history of game design¬†¬†
is inextricably linked to the¬†
history of controller design.
And so it‚Äôs always fascinating to see what games¬†
arise when a new input method is introduced.
When Apple introduced the iPhone and iPad¬†
developers had to figure out how to make games¬†¬†
that would work exclusively on a touchscreen¬†
- no buttons, no analogue sticks, no d-pads.
And so game designers had to figure out how¬†
to make a game work exclusively with a finger.
And my pick of the bunch would be Fruit Ninja.
It‚Äôs a simple game: a bunch of apples, pears,¬†
bananas and coconuts are tossed up into the air.
And then you slash them to bits by¬†
dragging your finger over the screen.
No one would confuse Fruit Ninja for a complicated¬†
game but it‚Äôs still a lot of fun thanks, largely,¬†¬†
to that tactile way of interacting with the game.
It‚Äôs living proof that games need to be¬†
designed around the way we interact with them,¬†¬†
and that game design cannot¬†
be disconnected from hardware.
Fruit Ninja is available on iOS and Android.
Survival horror games have¬†
historically made players¬†¬†
feel powerless by reducing your combat abilities.
Perhaps giving you crappy weapons like a plank of¬†
wood, or reducing the amount of ammo you can find.
But with Amnesia, Frictional decided to go¬†
one step further: remove combat altogether.
Now all you can do is run,¬†
hide, and hope for the best.
But that‚Äôs only the beginning.
The game also has a sanity meter¬†
which is increased by staying in¬†¬†
the shadows or by looking at the monsters.
So to stay sane you‚Äôll need to make¬†
yourself visible and vulnerable,¬†¬†
and to merely glimpse at the¬†
game‚Äôs grotesque creatures.
Through these design decisions, Frictional¬†
made a horror game that was truly terrifying.
It basically created a whole new style of horror¬†
game which inspired both indie games and AAA.
Amnesia is available on Steam, and on¬†
consoles as part of the Amnesia Collection.
Also check out Frictional‚Äôs¬†
later games, such as SOMA.
If you want an example of a¬†
game with good side-quests,¬†¬†
look no further than Fallout: New Vegas.
This post-apocalyptic RPG is littered¬†
with side stories that are funny,¬†¬†
weird, spooky, and involving.
And almost all of them are staggeringly¬†
complex in the ways you can solve them.
You‚Äôll get choices, which will affect your¬†
karma and your standing with different groups.
You‚Äôll be able to skip¬†
sections with a skill check.
Maybe the quest will change depending¬†
on which companions you have with you.
And sometimes you can use your initiative to find¬†
another, more interesting way to get through.
Each of these quests is a little¬†
masterclass in RPG design.
In fact, The Witcher 3‚Äôs lead quest¬†
designer counts New Vegas as a big¬†¬†
influence on that game‚Äôs‚Ä¶¬†
also very good side quests.
Fallout: New Vegas is available¬†
on Steam and the Xbox store.
Civilization V starts with you establishing¬†
the first village on a prehistoric landscape.
And then it follows your journey over two¬†
thousand years as you expand your kingdom,¬†¬†
hoover up resources, discover new technologies,¬†¬†
do battle with your neighbours,¬†
and jet off into outer-space.
It is, indeed, a big game.
And so it seems like it would be¬†
overwhelmingly difficult to understand.
But Civilization, as a franchise,¬†
is surprisingly‚Ä¶ approachable.
And that‚Äôs for a few reasons.
One is what the original designers¬†
Sid Meier and Bruce Shelley call¬†¬†
the ‚Äòinverted pyramid of decision making‚Äô.
Basically: at the start you only have one choice¬†
to make: where to establish your first city.
Soon you‚Äôll have two choices: what to produce¬†
in your city, and where to send your first unit.
Your web of responsibilities then¬†
grows and grows to the point where¬†¬†
you‚Äôre making dozens of choices per turn.
But by that point you‚Äôre invested,¬†
and understand all the rules.
You also can‚Äôt discount the theme - which¬†
is, like, high school-level world history.
It‚Äôs easier to grok a game about Egyptians,¬†¬†
bananas, and warplanes than a game about¬†
Protoss, Vespene gas, and photon cannons.
Civilization will teach you to never underestimate¬†¬†
the power of using stuff that the¬†
player likely already knows about.
I picked Civilization V as it‚Äôs perhaps the¬†
most straightforward of the games so far,¬†¬†
but all six entries are superb.
How could this list possibly exist without Dark¬†
Souls? It rewrote so many rules for how game¬†¬†
design is supposed to work, and is arguably¬†
the most name-checked game in all of design.
Only one title is absolutely synonymous with¬†
the concept of ""this game is hard"", after all.
But if I had to focus on just¬†
one single aspect for this list,¬†¬†
then I'd point at the way¬†
the game deals with death.
When you die, you also drop all of the¬†
souls you were carrying at the time.
And because these things act as an ultra¬†
powerful currency - used to power up your¬†¬†
character and to buy new stuff from¬†
shops - it's vitally important that¬†¬†
you make your way back to your dead¬†
body and pick your stash back up.
But if you die on route...¬†
the souls are gone for good.
This simple concept hangs¬†
over your head at all times.
When you've been exploring for ages and have¬†
a massive stack of souls in your pocket,¬†¬†
you become desperate to find a bonfire.
And when you're heading back to your¬†
stash with 20,000 souls on the line,¬†¬†
every step feels dangerous.
Dark Souls didn't invent the¬†
concept of corpse-running,¬†¬†
but it definitely popularised it - and it¬†
now shows up in dozens of different games.
For good or ill.
Dark Souls is available on all major¬†
platforms, as a Remastered version.
 ¬†
Minecraft can be fun when you¬†
treat it like a digital Lego set.
No enemies, no health bar, no hunger meter.
And infinite access to all the blocks.
Just build stuff - whether¬†
that‚Äôs the USS Enterprise,¬†¬†
or a rollercoaster, or a working computer.
Whatever takes your fancy.
But it‚Äôs also fun when you¬†
treat it like a survival game.
A harrowing fight against the elements¬†
where you have to scavenge for every block,¬†¬†
and slowly build a base that will keep¬†
you safe from a litany of enemy mobs.
And it‚Äôs fun, still, when played with¬†
others - whether you‚Äôre building together,¬†¬†
working together, or playing¬†
in a more competitive fashion.
Minecraft‚Äôs greatest strength is that¬†
the game is whatever you make of it.
The game does not impose rules or structure¬†
- it leaves it up to the player to decide.
That has made it an evergreen title, and proof¬†¬†
that many players love an opportunity¬†
to set their own goals and be creative.
Minecraft is available on every platform¬†
under the sun - though the PC version¬†¬†
is particularly interesting as¬†
you can install past versions.
Check out Minecraft 1.0 to see how things begun.
Spacechem, by Zachtronics, is a great¬†
example of a ""problem solving"" game.
Unlike puzzle games, which are about¬†
finding a single, specific solution,¬†¬†
problem solving games are about¬†
making up your own damn answer.
Anything that works.
So the game tasks you with building automated¬†
factories that can turn atoms into molecules.
And as long as your build¬†
meets the brief, you‚Äôll pass.
This makes your solution feel deeply personal.
Designer Zach Barth notes¬†
that ""people have a really¬†¬†
strong sense of ownership"" over their creations.
The set-up also encourages replayablity¬†
in a way that most puzzle games don‚Äôt.
You‚Äôll see how your machine scores when compared¬†
to other players, under three different criteria.
Seeing your solution come in well¬†
below the average can be more than¬†¬†
enough motivation to go back and¬†
in and improve your creation.
To make it faster, leaner, cheaper.
Spacechem is on Steam - but¬†
check out Zach‚Äôs other games¬†¬†
too - like the 3D Infinifactory¬†
and the hex-based Opus Magnum.
Look, Skyrim is not the best western RPG.
You‚Äôll get better quests, better¬†
stories, better character customisation,¬†¬†
better everything by playing The¬†
Witcher 3 or Baldur‚Äôs Gate 3.
But Skyrim is still the¬†
quintessential role-playing game.
A massive fantasy world that you¬†
can explore in any way you want.
You can go where you please, following¬†
points of interest or curiosity.
You can play how you want -¬†
perhaps focusing on magic spells,¬†¬†
hand-to-hand combat, or firing¬†
sneaky arrows from the shadows.
And the story of your adventure is entirely¬†
yours - driven by the places you go,¬†¬†
the characters you meet,¬†
and the quests you tackle.
All modern RPGs - from Elden Ring to Cyberpunk¬†
2077 - can be referred back to Skyrim,¬†¬†
making it an essential touchstone¬†
for any student of game design.
It‚Äôs also available on every device under the sun,¬†¬†
as Bethesda will seemingly¬†
never stop porting this thing.
Journey reimagines the concept of what it¬†
means to play with others over the internet.
Most so-called social games are either nakedly¬†
transactional or violent zero-sum competitions.
Journey is different.
So the game features an anonymous¬†
robed figure who is wandering a desert,¬†¬†
before climbing an impossibly tall mountain.
As you progress you may come across another hooded¬†
figure - who is controlled by another player.
And you can choose to travel¬†
alongside them for a while.
But you can‚Äôt speak to each¬†
other over text or a headset.
You can‚Äôt see each other‚Äôs name.
You can‚Äôt compete with,¬†
frustrate, or kill each other.
And the only way to actually¬†
communicate is with a single¬†¬†
button that makes you call out a musical note.
In fact, some players might not even¬†
realise that they were working alongside¬†¬†
a real human until the very end, when¬†
your partner‚Äôs name is finally revealed.
But still - the connection you make with this¬†
other character is surprisingly deep and close.
This non-traditional approach to cooperation¬†
leads to a very memorable experience,¬†¬†
and proves there are more ways to play¬†
together than simply killing each other.
Journey is a beautiful game that¬†
should be experienced first hand.
It‚Äôs on Steam and PlayStation consoles.
When designer Nels Anderson made Mark of the¬†
Ninja, he wanted to make a side scrolling¬†¬†
take on a favourite stealth game:¬†
Thief, which I talked about earlier.
But he made one change to the way Thief works¬†
- which makes Mark of the Ninja actually feel¬†¬†
like a completely different game, and¬†
can teach us a lot about game design.
The change comes in the form of information.
Where Thief gives you very little¬†
feedback on the state of the world,¬†¬†
Mark of the Ninja is drenched in it.
UI elements will tell you if you‚Äôre¬†
in light, or hidden in shadows.
It shows you exactly how far¬†
a sound is reverberating.
It shows you what guards can see, what they‚Äôre¬†
thinking, and what decisions they‚Äôre making.
And it even shows you what items¬†
will do, before you use them.
So where Thief was a game about patient¬†
observation and immersing yourself in¬†¬†
a world, Mark of the Ninja‚Äôs information overload¬†¬†
turns this into a game about¬†
creating plans and strategies.
You can use your info advantage to¬†
sneak past guards, to distract them,¬†¬†
to lure them into traps, and so on.
By showing the player exactly how the world¬†
works, the player feels powerful and capable.
It‚Äôs an effective lesson on how your¬†
interaction with a world changes,¬†¬†
depending on how much you know about it.
Mark of the Ninja is available on Steam, and¬†
all the consoles as a Remastered edition.
Developer Telltale Games started life by¬†
making point and click adventure games¬†¬†
that harkened back to ‚Äò90s classics¬†
like Monkey Island and Sam and Max.
Games with goofy puzzles and esoteric solutions.
But the studio really hit it big when it put away¬†¬†
the puzzles and focused squarely on¬†
storytelling and character growth.
So The Walking Dead has very few¬†
moments where you‚Äôre using a monkey¬†¬†
as a monkey wrench or gluing¬†
cat hair to your upper lip.
Instead, the game is about making difficult¬†¬†
moral decisions in the face of¬†
a terrifying zombie apocalypse.
Playing as Lee Everett, you‚Äôre¬†
routinely dropped into tricky¬†¬†
situations where you‚Äôll need to¬†
carefully decide what to do next.
Who should get food when supplies are low? Who¬†
should come with you on a mission, and who should¬†¬†
stay behind? And in moments of true peril - who¬†
should you save, and who should you leave to die?
At its best, The Walking Dead creates some truly¬†
powerful moments that tug on your heartstrings¬†¬†
and make you feel guilt and regret in the¬†
way that only an interactive story can.
And it rarely lets you sit and think on your¬†
choices - dialogue boxes have a decaying¬†¬†
timer above them, and some actions must be¬†
triggered on the spot durning cutscenes.
And then, as the episodes go on,¬†¬†
you‚Äôll see your decisions fan out¬†
and carry over to later chapters.
Small decisions are referenced, but big¬†
decisions can have dramatic ripples on the story.
The Walking Dead kicked off a¬†
whole new era of games at Telltale,¬†¬†
but also influenced other¬†
games like Life is Strange.
The first season is available¬†
on all four platforms.
Virtue‚Äôs Last Reward is another¬†
game with difficult decisions,¬†¬†
branching paths, and multiple endings.
But this time the assumption is not that you will¬†¬†
play through the game once (and maybe¬†
look up the other endings on YouTube).
That‚Äôs because when you finish the narrative,¬†¬†
you‚Äôll be given access to a massive¬†
flowchart showing you how the story¬†¬†
rippled out from one decision to another,¬†
and finally to one of the game‚Äôs endings.
And with this you can now jump¬†
around - inserting yourself back¬†¬†
into the narrative at different points¬†
and then making different choices.
With this time-travelling, multiverse-hopping¬†
super power, you can unlock even more¬†¬†
endings - perhaps learning a password in¬†
one timeline, and then using it in another.
Or finding out a secret about a¬†
character and using it to gain¬†¬†
their trust in a completely different universe.
Virtue‚Äôs Last Reward takes a staple¬†
of interactive storytelling and turns¬†¬†
it into a game of its own, making it an¬†
essential touchstone for branching paths.
Virtue‚Äôs Last Reward is available on Steam, Xbox,¬†¬†
and PlayStation as part of The Nonary Games,¬†
which also includes the previous title, 999.
If there‚Äôs one feature that XCOM: Enemy Unknown¬†
designer Jake Solomon regrets, it‚Äôs hit chances.
So, XCOM is a tightly designed tactical¬†
game, where you do battle with alien nasties.
You‚Äôll tell your squad members where to go,¬†¬†
where to take cover, which weapons to¬†
use, and which aliens to take a shot at.
But whether or not that shot¬†
lands‚Ä¶ is down to lady luck.
Before you take action, the game¬†
gives you a percentage chance¬†¬†
for your shot landing - a number¬†
driven by sight-lines and distance.
An alien ten metres away will perhaps¬†
have a 80% chance of taking damage.
It‚Äôs also worth mentioning that these¬†
numbers are, effectively, made up.
Humans are bad at understanding odds so that 80%¬†¬†
chance on screen is actually¬†
closer to 90 in the code.
But after that, what happens next is down to luck.
And while it can lead to some great moments,¬†
it‚Äôs more likely to lead to disappointment.
It‚Äôs such a hit in the gut for your¬†
strategy to go completely wrong,¬†¬†
simply because of a lousy die roll.
That‚Äôs why Solomon removed them in his¬†
next non-XCOM game, Marvel‚Äôs Midnight Sons.
Now - don‚Äôt get me wrong.
XCOM is an awesome game with loads of¬†
other great design lessons to teach.
But at the same time, when someone needs¬†
an example of output randomness - i.e.,¬†¬†
luck is applied after you take an¬†
action - XCOM is the go-to game.
It‚Äôs available on Steam and the Xbox store.
Spec Ops: The Line is always my go-to¬†
game when talking about invisible choices.
Basically: when games give players a¬†
choice, this is usually done with a¬†¬†
big pop-up box asking the player¬†
which option they want to pick.
A or B? The heroic one or the¬†
evil one? This guy or that guy?
And that‚Äôs fine - but Spec Ops¬†
shows another way to do it.
The game will regularly put you into¬†
difficult decision-making moments,¬†¬†
but then ask you to make your choice¬†
by using the basic actions of the game.
In this case: aim and shoot.
So, for instance, in this moment you are asked¬†
to shoot at one of these two strung-up men.
This opens up opportunities to let the player¬†¬†
make choices beyond A and B -¬†
maybe you don‚Äôt shoot either.
Maybe you shoot at the snipers in the distance.
Maybe you shoot both, you psychopath.
The game is packed with these things,¬†¬†
which feels more immersive and organic¬†
than picking between two coloured buttons.
Sadly, Spec Ops: The Line has¬†
been pulled from all storefronts,¬†¬†
so you‚Äôll have to dig out a physical¬†
copy of the game to play it today.
With the proliferation of the internet, local¬†
multiplayer games took a bit of a backseat.
But every now and again, a game¬†
would remind us how much fun it¬†¬†
could be to play together in the same space.
Take, for instance, Spaceteam - which is¬†
described as a ‚Äòcooperative shouting game‚Äô.
Basically, each player has a¬†
spaceship control panel with a¬†¬†
unique set of controls, dials, knobs, and levers.
And each player will be given commands that¬†
must be followed to keep the spaceship working.
As the commands are often for another player‚Äôs¬†
control panel, you‚Äôll need to bark instructions¬†¬†
at each other, and simultaneously listen out for¬†
instructions that pertain to your control panel.
Which leads to a game of, well, a lot of shouting.
It‚Äôs a blast to play and a great¬†
example of what can be gained by¬†¬†
making experiences designed for local play.
SpaceTeam is sadly long gone from the iOS App¬†
Store, but it‚Äôs still available on Android.
There‚Äôs a lot to love about Dishonored - from its¬†¬†
pitch-perfect stealth mechanics¬†
to its world-class level design.
But the thing I want to focus on is the way¬†
the game world reacts to the way you play.
Throughout Dishonored you‚Äôre able to¬†
choose what sort of assassin you are:¬†¬†
a sneaky ghost who is never seen, or a chaotic¬†
angel of death who rips every guard in half.
And that extends to all of your targets: there‚Äôs¬†
always a non-lethal approach, if you so choose.
Whatever you decide, Dishonored¬†
never explicitly judges your actions.
You‚Äôre not classed as ‚Äògood‚Äô or ‚Äòevil‚Äô, and you¬†
don‚Äôt grow devil horns or suddenly sprout a halo.
Instead, those decisions subtly¬†
ripple out into the world.
The level of chaos you cause¬†
is reflected in the state of¬†¬†
the city - with the streets taken over by¬†
hordes of rats at the highest chaos levels.
The NPCs are also affected and you¬†
might find that certain characters¬†¬†
are unwilling to help - or may actually turn¬†
against you - if you cause too much chaos.
It‚Äôs an interesting take on a karma system,¬†¬†
and makes players consider their actions¬†
but without it feeling overly game-y.
Dishonored is on Steam and on Xbox consoles.
Sometimes the best way to learn about game design¬†
is to play a title that seeks to poke fun at it.
The Stanley Parable is a satirical¬†
game about narrative and game-design¬†¬†
conventions - specifically player choice.
And so through an unreliable narrator,¬†
fourth-wall breaking moments,¬†¬†
and lots of jokes made at your expense,¬†
it will make you laugh - and then make¬†¬†
you think about how games get you to make¬†
certain decisions, and feel certain ways.
Ultimately, creator Davey Wreden just wanted¬†
to bamboozle you, saying his intent was to¬†¬†
""mess with the player's head in every¬†
way possible, throwing them off-guard,¬†¬†
or pretending there's an answer and then¬†
kinda whisking it away from in front of them"".
He also hoped that the game would¬†
spark discussion and debate afterwards.
It certainly did, considering the fact¬†
that we‚Äôre still talking about it today.
The game is on Steam, and on other platforms¬†
as part of the Ultra Deluxe Edition.
Also check out Wreden‚Äôs follow-up, The Beginner‚Äôs¬†
Guide, for more fourth-wall breaking shenanigans.
It‚Äôs almost impossible to explain Brothers: A¬†
Tale of Two Sons without spoiling its best moment.
But I‚Äôll try.
The game follows two brothers¬†
on a journey to uncover some¬†¬†
magical water that will save their dying father.
But you don‚Äôt control just one brother,¬†¬†
or swap between them - you actually¬†
control both, simultaneously, with¬†¬†
one analogue stick and half the shoulder¬†
buttons dedicated to each of the boys.
This kicks off a journey where you‚Äôll¬†
have to be in two places at once.
You‚Äôll be solving puzzles that you‚Äôd¬†
usually see in a co-op game - you know:¬†¬†
one character distracts an enemy while the other¬†
slips past - but now you‚Äôre doing it by yourself.
Over the course of this imaginative¬†
fairy-tale journey, Brothers so firmly¬†¬†
establishes the two boys as existing in your¬†
left and right thumbs that the most impactful¬†¬†
storytelling happens not on screen -¬†
but actually on the controller itself.
It‚Äôs a remarkable piece of interactive¬†
storytelling that should be¬†¬†
required reading for anyone wishing¬†
to tell a narrative through gameplay.
Brothers is available on Steam and consoles, but¬†
I‚Äôd avoid the unattractive remake if I were you.
In 2010, game research Ian Bogost made a parody¬†¬†
game - designed to poke fun¬†
at mindless Facebook apps.
So Cow Clicker was FarmVille - but¬†
boiled down to its absolute essentials.
The player has a pasture containing¬†
a single cow which you can click,¬†¬†
once every six hours, to make a number go up.
It was supposed to be a one-note joke to¬†
show how Zynga could get players addicted¬†¬†
with the most stupidly simple gameplay‚Ä¶ and¬†
then players became addicted to Cow Clicker.
It was a Facebook megahit¬†
with thousands of players,¬†¬†
and Bogost even started updating the¬†
game with more cows, and more mechanics.
It proved that for some players‚Ä¶ clicking on a¬†
thing to make a number go up was a good time.
The logical conclusion of Cow¬†
Clicker was Cookie Clicker.
Again, you‚Äôre clicking on an¬†
image to make numbers go up.
But now there are upgrades and unlocks that can¬†
make you click faster, or do the clicking for you.
This so called idle or incremental¬†
game is kind of‚Ä¶ nothing.
But it‚Äôs also weirdly compelling.
Even I will admit to having sunk a few¬†
hours into increasing my cookie empire.
What you take from Cookie Clicker is¬†
up to you - but I‚Äôd argue that as the¬†¬†
ultimate distillation of how players can¬†
get obsessed with upgrades, progression,¬†¬†
rewards, and optimisation, it‚Äôs¬†
an essential game to know about.
You can play it in your¬†
browser or get it on Steam.
Gone Home is still, in my¬†
mind, the quintessential - uh,¬†¬†
walking simulator? I guess¬†
that genre name has stuck.
So in this game you play as a young woman who has¬†¬†
returned to her family home, to¬†
find the whole place abandoned.
So to figure out what‚Äôs happened in your¬†
absence you‚Äôll need to root through your¬†¬†
family‚Äôs possessions and piece together the story.
It is, then, a game about reading¬†
notes, receipts, birthday cards,¬†¬†
shampoo bottles, and poorly produced zines.
Which, might sound a little¬†
dull on the surface - but it¬†¬†
actually makes for a tremendously compelling game.
And that‚Äôs simply because the real¬†
gameplay is happening in your head.
With each note you find, you‚Äôre mentally filling¬†
in blanks, making assumptions and connections,¬†¬†
and fleshing out what you¬†
know about these characters.
And because it‚Äôs a game, you naturally find these¬†¬†
objects in a somewhat random order¬†
- or maybe miss objects entirely.
This makes your understanding¬†
of the narrative feel personal¬†¬†
and hard won - putting you in the¬†
role of an amateur archeologist.
Games have long featured environmental¬†
storytelling - which is when a narrative is¬†¬†
baked into the level design itself - but Gone Home¬†¬†
proved that this alone could make¬†
for a fascinating game experience.
Gone Home is available on all major platforms.
Papers, Please proves that video games are perhaps¬†¬†
the best medium for putting¬†
you in another person‚Äôs shoes.
The games casts you as a border agent of a¬†
fictional soviet country, and you have to¬†¬†
check each entrant‚Äôs documents before deciding¬†
whether to let them in, or turn them away,
At the start it‚Äôs a fun game of¬†
spot the difference and deduction.
You have to look for discrepancies in¬†
their documents, or spot ways that their¬†¬†
application is breaking some rule or regulation.
But then you‚Äôll meet characters¬†
who stop you in your tracks.
Perhaps someone who desperately needs¬†
to get in - a woman fleeing persecution,¬†¬†
say - but their passport is out of¬†
date or their paperwork is incomplete.
Do you let them in, and live with¬†
the risk and the penalty? Or do¬†¬†
you follow the rules and damn them to their fate?
In this precise moment, Papers, Please makes the¬†
case for games as a powerful artistic medium.
Capable of not just showing you why people¬†
make certain decisions, but by putting you¬†¬†
right there in that situation and asking‚Ä¶¬†
what would you do? The game is on Steam
SteamWorld Dig operates on a gameplay¬†
loop that can be‚Ä¶ hazardously addictive.
Here‚Äôs how it works.
As tinpot robot Rusty, you‚Äôre trying to¬†¬†
dig through a gigantic mine¬†
that hides beneath your town.
But the only problem is: you‚Äôre¬†
not the most adept miner.
At the beginning of the game you only¬†
have a small health bar, a crappy pickaxe,¬†¬†
a tiny lantern, and enough inventory¬†
space to hold about 3 lumps of gold.
So, soon enough, you‚Äôre back at the surface.
You sell your plundered gold for cash¬†
and then head to the upgrade shop¬†¬†
where you can buy better equipment.
A stronger pickaxe, say, or a better lantern.
And then it‚Äôs back into the mine,¬†
so you can dig a little deeper.
Stick around for a little longer.
And find a little more gold for the¬†
next time you‚Äôre back on the surface.
This repeats, over and over again,¬†¬†
keeping you stuck in a trance as you¬†
just want to go a little bit deeper.
In the wrong hands, this can be¬†
a hollow gameplay loop that only¬†¬†
serves to artificially pad out a game‚Äôs length.
But, luckily, SteamWorld Dig¬†
also has varied gameplay,¬†¬†
an interesting storyline,¬†
and enticing secrets to find.
Whatever the case - you‚Äôll see¬†
this loop in all sorts of games,¬†¬†
making it an essential design concept to learn.
SteamWorld Dig is available¬†
on all major platforms.
Making believable AI characters is¬†
difficult - so how about you focus¬†¬†
your efforts on making just¬†
one, really good AI opponent?
That‚Äôs the idea behind Alien:¬†
Isolation - a truly terrifying¬†¬†
horror game that puts you up against¬†
one of the most famous movie monsters.
As you explore the space station -¬†
solving problems, dealing with androids,¬†¬†
and navigating to new areas - you‚Äôll¬†
be stalked by an unstoppable Xenomorph.
The monster is driven by a number of complex¬†
systems - allowing the alien to see and hear¬†¬†
the player, to sneak up behind you,¬†
and to respond realistically to fire.
Most importantly, the Alien‚Äôs movements¬†
are rarely predetermined by the designers.
As designer Gary Napper explains,¬†¬†
""we needed something that would be¬†
different every time you played it.
You're going to die a lot,¬†
which means restarting a lot,¬†¬†
and if the alien was scripted,¬†
you'd see the same behaviour.
That makes the alien become¬†
predictable, and a lot less scary.""
Another clever trick is that the¬†
alien will be given access to new¬†¬†
abilities and strategies as the¬†
game goes along - which creates¬†¬†
the illusion that the alien is learning¬†
from its interactions with the player.
Alien: Isolation is an important touchstone¬†
for terrifying AI-driven characters.
And it‚Äôs available on all major platforms.
Mario Kart is always the go-to example¬†
when it comes to talking about balancing¬†¬†
a game around players of different skill levels.
And it comes down to the way¬†
the game doles out items.
When you race through one of these item¬†
boxes, the result is far from random.
Instead, the power-up you get is entirely¬†
determined by your position in the race.
If you‚Äôre up front - i.e., you‚Äôre doing well - the¬†¬†
game will give you relatively weak¬†
items like green shells and coins.
But if you‚Äôre towards the back of the¬†
pack - i.e., you‚Äôre struggling - the game¬†¬†
will grant you super powerful weapons like the¬†
superstar, the bullet bill, or the blue shell:¬†¬†
a missile whose sole mission is to¬†
seek out the person in first place.
This creates a negative feedback¬†
loop - a self-balancing system¬†¬†
where struggling players are given a helping hand,¬†¬†
and where expert racers are held back -¬†
giving everyone a chance to have fun together.
Such systems can be found¬†
in all sorts of multiplayer¬†¬†
games - especially social and party games.
But you only need to namecheck the blue shell for¬†¬†
any game designer to know¬†
what you‚Äôre talking about.
Mario Kart 8 is on Wii U - but feel free to check¬†
out the expanded Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on Switch.
Adventure games started with text.
Games like Colossal Cave Adventure and¬†
Zork described the game world with words,¬†¬†
and invited you to interact with a text parser.
Eventually, technology allowed for graphics¬†¬†
and mouse input - leading to¬†
point and click adventures.
But the text adventure‚Ä¶ it never went away.
It morphed into interactive fiction¬†
and has been quietly ticking along¬†¬†
in the background ever since, through¬†
games like Photopia, Depression Quest,¬†¬†
and, my pick of the bunch, 80 Days - a¬†
beautiful reimagining of Jules Verne‚Äôs¬†¬†
novel where you make your way around the¬†
world by various methods of transport.
More than anything, this game really shows the¬†
power of using text as your primary technology.
Because here‚Äôs the truth: text is cheap.
It takes just a single paragraph to¬†
introduce a player to an entire city¬†¬†
or a new character - things that, in other¬†
games, would require 3D models, textures,¬†¬†
artificial intelligence, and voice acting.
And so 80 Days is a big game.
Inkle‚Äôs co-founder Jon Ingold says¬†
""on one complete play through,¬†¬†
you see perhaps 3% of the¬†
text that‚Äôs in the game"".
And so you‚Äôre encouraged to¬†
play the whole thing again,¬†¬†
this time taking different routes¬†
and making different decisions.
Some of the games on this list feature branching¬†
paths and choices that ripple out into the¬†¬†
narrative - but they pale in comparison¬†
to what Inkle can achieve through text.
80 Days is available on Steam and Switch.
Her Story, by Sam Barlow, is a perfect example¬†
of what some call the ‚Äòinformation game‚Äô.
The game sits you down in front of a database,¬†¬†
containing interviews with a woman who‚Äôs¬†
giving testimony about her husband‚Äôs murder.
And the entire story - who¬†
killed him, why they did it,¬†¬†
and everything that led to it -¬†
is right there on the database.
But‚Ä¶ you can‚Äôt just watch the¬†
story in chronological order.
Instead, the tapes are cut up into almost¬†
300 short clips and stored on a clunky PC¬†¬†
interface that asks you to type in words to¬†
unearth the clips that feature those words.
This strange, and slightly contrived system¬†
means you have to uncover the plot for yourself.
To find new clips you‚Äôll need to pay¬†
close attention to Hannah‚Äôs testimony¬†¬†
and think up words that will help¬†
you search through this massive web.
And the clips you do find are rarely in order,¬†¬†
so you‚Äôll need to piece together¬†
the narrative from disparate clues.
¬†
It turns you into something halfway¬†
between a detective and an archeologist.
You‚Äôre following leads and doing¬†
deductive reasoning - but also¬†¬†
piecing together the past using¬†
an incomplete set of facts.
It‚Äôs a wonderful experience, and a¬†
striking example of how withholding¬†¬†
information from the player can¬†
lead to compelling gameplay.
Her Story is on Steam, Xbox, and mobile.
To help me pick the perfect games for this list,¬†¬†
I totted up all the games I‚Äôve ever shown on Game¬†
Maker‚Äôs Toolkit, and ordered them by frequency.
And of the more than 1000 games¬†
I‚Äôve discussed on this channel,¬†¬†
there‚Äôs one game that‚Äôs appeared more than any¬†
other: Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain.
Why? Well, it‚Äôs just a great¬†
example of so many design concepts.
For instance, it‚Äôs a great showing of¬†
systemic design, as each enemy camp¬†¬†
is filled with complex AI agents that¬†
can be tricked, lured out, and trapped.
The Fulton extraction system is all¬†
about letting the player decide how¬†¬†
to play this stealth game: by killing¬†
soldiers, or turning them into allies.
The scoring system allows you to play¬†
the levels in whatever way you like,¬†¬†
but rewards players who are quick and stealthy.
The game makes failure fun, by switching the¬†
game from a slow and sneaky stealth game‚Ä¶ into¬†¬†
a manic action movie full of explosions¬†
and last-minute helicopter extractions.
And the AI tries to learn from your actions -¬†
perhaps giving the guards helmets if you keep¬†¬†
doing headshots or bringing in floodlights¬†
if you always tackle bases at night.
This puts a stop to you doing the same optimum¬†
strategies and forces you to mix up your approach.
Oh, and also this shot of Snake with¬†
a prosthetic arm is a great visual to¬†¬†
use whenever I mention accessibility,¬†
which probably puffed up the numbers.
But whatever the case, MGS V is full of¬†
great little design lessons and ideas,¬†¬†
making it a must-play for anyone -¬†
not just those making stealth games.
The Phantom Pain is on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation.
We sometimes ignore the fact that, in most¬†
games, we‚Äôre playing as a mass murderer.
The story might say we‚Äôre a good guy - but just¬†¬†
consider the body count of¬†
an average shooter or RPG.
You‚Äôre basically committing¬†
genocide every time you play.
Undertale puts this fact into sharp relief.
This is a short and quirky RPG where you¬†¬†
can choose how to deal with¬†
every enemy you come across.
You can either defeat them, like normal.
Or you can find a way to spare the monster -¬†
perhaps by talking to them, flattering them,¬†¬†
listening to their dialogue, or just holding¬†
out long enough for them to get bored and leave.
With this in mind, you can play through the game¬†¬†
in different ways - perhaps trying to¬†
spare every enemy and boss character,¬†¬†
or simply going on a psychopathic genocide run¬†
where you mow down every monster in your way.
The game reacts to your choices -¬†
giving different plot points and¬†¬†
ending scenes depending on how you choose to play.
But things get even more interesting¬†
on a second playthrough, as the game¬†¬†
comments on your earlier decisions, and your¬†
choice to come back and try something new.
Should it be possible to undo your¬†
destruction, just by starting a new save file?
Undertale is worth playing simply for being¬†
an RPG that doesn‚Äôt take 30 hours to finish.
But it‚Äôs also an important reference point¬†
for how games handle morality and murder.
It‚Äôs available on all major platforms.
Downwell is always my go-to example when¬†
talking about ""dual purpose design"",¬†¬†
or the idea that one mechanic¬†
can have more than one function.
So, the jump button doubles up as your¬†
shoot button when used in mid-air.
Shooting kills enemies, breaks¬†
blocks, and slows your descent.
Killing enemies reloads your gun¬†
boots and can add to your combo.
And landing on the ground clears¬†
your combo and resets your ammo.
Because everything in the game¬†
is doing two or more jobs,¬†¬†
we get a game with a lot of depth¬†
for half the number of mechanics.
Downwell is also a great¬†
example of risk and reward.
The best way to play is to jump on enemies,¬†¬†
rather than shooting them - that¬†
will net you the biggest rewards.
But this is decidedly more risky so it‚Äôs¬†
only intended for more seasoned players.
With this, Downwell has a natural¬†
difficulty curve where new players¬†¬†
will shoot enemies and just try¬†
to survive, while expert players¬†¬†
will eventually decide to graduate to¬†
bopping enemies and playing for score.
Downwell is on all major platforms.
Video games have a unique opportunity to¬†
transport us to new and interesting locations.
To let us play as virtual¬†
tourists and interlopers.
And few games do that better than Yakuza 0.
This game - and to be honest, all of the games in¬†¬†
the Yakuza series - take place in a¬†
beautifully realised Tokyo district.
And while Kamurocho doesn‚Äôt really exist‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs¬†
extremely close to its real life counterpart,
Kaboo.. key... cho...
Kaboocheeko...
I should have... I should have prepared that¬†
better before I got in the recording booth.
Yakuza achieves this through extremely¬†
detailed recreations of Japanese shops,¬†¬†
vending machines, and buildings.
By letting you buy familiar foodstuff¬†
from convenience stores and restaurants.
And by giving you all sorts of side activities¬†
that make you feel like a local - whether¬†¬†
that‚Äôs darts, karaoke, a hostess bar,¬†
or an arcade filled with Sega machines.
The idea of ""the city is almost another¬†
character!"" is trotted out a lot,¬†¬†
but it‚Äôs very true of the Yakuza games.
And it only gets better the more of them you play.
It might be cheeky to reuse the same city¬†
block across almost 20 years of games but¬†¬†
it‚Äôs always a joy to return to Kamurocho - to¬†
see how it changes and how it stays the same.
Oh, and also you can smash a bicycle¬†
over people‚Äôs heads and stuff.
It‚Äôs great.
Yakuza 0 is available on¬†
Steam, PlayStation, and Xbox.
Minecraft proved that some¬†
players love to build stuff.
Kerbal Space Program shows what fun can be¬†
had when you throw physics into the mix.
This game is all about building rockets,¬†
with the hope of launching them into¬†¬†
space - without everything blowing up¬†
or spinning around like a mad pinwheel.
There are plenty of games about creating¬†
detailed, simulated mechanisms - but¬†¬†
few with such a clear and obvious goal as¬†
""get this thing to this very high point"".
And fewer still that are as funny as Kerbal.
Because physics are a tricky¬†
thing to wrangle in games.
Designers typically want to have a lot¬†
of control over how their games work,¬†¬†
and physics are - by their nature¬†
- unpredictable and fickle.
But physics are almost always¬†
funny and so while Kerbal is¬†¬†
definitely serious and grounded¬†
and praised by NASA technicians¬†¬†
for its realism - its also just endlessly¬†
hilarious to see your incredible creation,¬†¬†
which took hours to painstakingly build,¬†
immediately fall apart and blow up.
Kerbal Space Program is available¬†
on Steam, PlayStation, and Xbox.
While playing games will certainly¬†
teach you a lot about game design,¬†¬†
you'll learn even more by jumping¬†
in and making games for yourself.
However, I know full well that starting¬†
from scratch can be quite intimidating,¬†¬†
so perhaps it's best to start by playing¬†
around in someone else's playground.
Super Mario Maker lets you do just that.
This lets you make your own levels using¬†
the tools, rules and visuals of the Super¬†¬†
Mario platformers, and so you can see for yourself¬†
what it's like to construct a level from scratch.
You'll soon realise that it's not easy to¬†
make something that's actually fun to play,¬†¬†
and so as you improve your skills, try other¬†
people's levels and hunt down hints and tips,¬†¬†
you'll soon realise that you're making¬†
your first stab at level design.
Sadly, Mario Maker's Wii U¬†
servers are now shut down,¬†¬†
so it's impossible to share your user-made levels.
So feel free to go straight to the¬†
sequel on Switch if you prefer.
Whenever I need an example of a game where every¬†
design decision points in the same direction.
Where every choice was made to¬†
elevate the central fantasy.
I go for Doom - the 2016 follow-up¬†
to that pioneering FPS of the 1990s.
This game wants you to feel like¬†
a brutal demon-slaying badass,¬†¬†
and does this with every fibre of its being: from¬†
the movement speed, to the weapon designs, to way¬†¬†
the protagonist ends Zoom calls in the way we‚Äôd¬†
all like to: by smashing the computer to bits.
But my absolute favourite idea is the glory kill.
Basically: Doom is not a game¬†
with regenerating health bars.
You do not lick your wounds by cowering¬†
behind a box or a knee-high wall.
Instead, the best way to get health is to shoot¬†
demons until they are staggered - and then run¬†¬†
up close and trigger a gory execution animation¬†
- a move which showers you with health pick-ups.
It‚Äôs a move thats guaranteed to make¬†
you feel like a ruthless predator.
You have to run directly towards enemies,¬†
in a genre that typically favours retreat.
And because it‚Äôs tied to¬†
such an essential resource,¬†¬†
id Software makes you do it¬†
again and again and again.
And it feels amazing every time.
Doom is all on major platforms.
Okay, so in Factorio, you‚Äôve crash¬†
landed on this barren alien planet.
And you‚Äôve got one goal in¬†
mind: build a new spaceship.
But mining all the resources by hand,¬†¬†
and forging all the components one by¬†
one‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs going to be a lot of work.
So this is where Factorio‚Äôs gift to¬†
gaming comes in: the joy of automation.
The ultimate goal is to build a¬†
self-sustaining factory that can¬†¬†
harvest, smelt, and forge new suff all by itself.
To create a planet-wide network of production¬†
chains, all linked up by trains and drones.
It‚Äôs a bit like Spacechem, but bigger,¬†
more open ended, and even more maddening.
You can lose hundreds of hours to this game as you¬†¬†
fall into a rabbit hole of problem¬†
solving and productivity growth.
I mean, if I completely redesign my entire factory¬†
I‚Äôll get two more copper plates per minute.
Worth it, right?
The game is on Steam and Nintendo Switch.
Persona 5 is very much a game of two halves.
On the one hand, it‚Äôs a life simulator¬†
about a bunch of kids at high school.
You‚Äôll go to class, hang out in the cafeteria,¬†¬†
do after-school jobs and chores, go to the¬†
movie theatre, buy clothes, and go on dates.
But on the other hand, it‚Äôs a dungeon-crawling¬†
RPG where you waltz through palaces,¬†¬†
do battle with demons, collect¬†
monster allies, and loot treasure.
Then it‚Äôs back to school again.
Having the player jump between¬†
genres can be great for pacing.
As soon as you‚Äôre getting¬†
bored of endless RPG battles,¬†¬†
the game sends you back to the real world¬†
for conversations and character growth.
And when that starts to drag,¬†
it‚Äôs back to the action.
But this can be troublesome: if the¬†
player only likes one aspect of the game,¬†¬†
or spends too long on one half of the experience,¬†¬†
jumping back to the other style of¬†
gameplay can feel jarring or frustrating.
But that‚Äôs rarely the case in¬†
Persona - and that's because¬†¬†
everything revolves around a¬†
singular core of friendship.
Joker‚Äôs pals are his friends in the social¬†
simulator and his party members in the RPG,¬†¬†
and so no matter what you‚Äôre doing, those¬†
friendships are being explored and evolved.
Persona 5 Royal is available on all platforms.
Hitman is a game about mastery and repetition.
The game puts you in the shoes of Agent 47¬†
- who is tasked with visiting some exotic¬†¬†
locale and assassinating some very naughty person.
Now, Agent 47 is depicted as the¬†
ultimate assassin - a person so¬†¬†
perfect, that he makes murder seem effortless.
But, despite this, you‚Äôre actually not expected¬†¬†
to do very well on your first¬†
attempt at one of these missions.
Things will inevitably go wrong.
You‚Äôll be spotted trespassing by a guard,¬†
you‚Äôll leave evidence behind, or perhaps¬†¬†
you‚Äôll have to kill an innocent civilian¬†
before they have a chance to raise the alarm.
You first go will likely see you reach¬†
the goal in the most messy way imaginable.
But that‚Äôs okay: because you can go again.
Hitman‚Äôs levels operate on a predictable¬†
clockwork choreography - events repeat¬†¬†
at the exact same time, targets¬†
walk on the same looping routes,¬†¬†
and objects show up in the same¬†
locations over and over again.
So you can use your ever-expanding¬†
knowledge of the level to do better.
With each repetition, you move closer and closer¬†
to becoming Agent 47 - to the point you can¬†¬†
assassinate your target without ever being¬†
spotted, or even changing out of your suit.
Where many games expect you¬†
to blow through content once,¬†¬†
and never see it again, Hitman proves the¬†
value of letting a player soak a level in.
‚ÄòRepetitive‚Äô isn‚Äôt necessarily a dirty word¬†
if it leads to a feeling of truly mastery.
Hitman is available everywhere except Switch,¬†
as part of the World of Assassination trilogy.
Overcooked is a game that can end¬†
friendships and relationships,¬†¬†
just as quickly as it can make them.
The game puts you and up to three friends¬†
in charge of a bustling restaurant kitchen¬†¬†
and you must work together to create the¬†
meals that are requested by customers.
This is done through things¬†
like getting ingredients,¬†¬†
chopping them, cooking them in an oven,¬†
and delivering them to front of house.
And so it seems sensible for each¬†
player to take on a single role,¬†¬†
focus on their task, and quietly¬†
repeat until the level is done.
But that‚Äôs not what happens - and¬†
it‚Äôs usually because of dirty plates.
No one wants to be the plate washer.
And, anyway, they come in at such¬†
an odd frequency that it would be¬†¬†
a waste for someone to focus entirely on that.
And so as soon as you run out of¬†
plates your perfect plan falls apart.
You shout at each other, you switch¬†
jobs, you get in each other‚Äôs way,¬†¬†
and if you‚Äôre not careful you‚Äôll fail the task.
So Overcooked is a cooperative game¬†
that forces you to actually cooperate.
To communicate, plan things out together, and to¬†
give each other a heads up when things change.
It‚Äôs manic, loud, and lots of fun.
And a great example of how to do co-op right.
Overcooked! is available everywhere.
Furi is the game that made¬†
me better at Dark Souls.
Maybe a strange claim about a¬†
game where you dodge in and out¬†¬†
of waves of neon-coloured bullets‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs true.
That‚Äôs because this boss rush adventure¬†
teaches you to focus on defending against¬†¬†
incoming attacks, as you patiently wait for¬†
an opening in your opponent‚Äôs attack pattern.
Then, when they‚Äôre vulnerable, you can rush in and¬†¬†
do a little damage‚Ä¶ before noping¬†
out and waiting for another turn.
Furi simply will not let you play this¬†
game like a button mashing maniac - which,¬†¬†
I admit, I have been guilty of in the past.
You can‚Äôt win by simply hitting the¬†
sword button as quickly as possible.
That will just leave you¬†
bruised, beaten, and fed up.
So through its simple, but¬†
elegantly designed combat system,¬†¬†
Furi will teach you patience and observation.
Each boss battle is like a long, slow,¬†
painful lesson in how to be better at¬†¬†
fighting this one exact dude, and you¬†
won‚Äôt move on until you get an A grade.
Furi is available on all major platforms.
The Zelda franchise changed¬†
a lot after the first game.
While the NES original allowed¬†
for freeform exploration of a¬†¬†
large world map, later Zelda games¬†
were more linear and restrictive.
Dungeons had to be done in a specific order,¬†¬†
and the games were structured¬†
around hitting specific story beats.
But with Breath of the Wild, Zelda finally went¬†
back to a game where player freedom is king.
After a brief tutorial section,¬†¬†
the game drops you into a post-apocalyptic¬†
Hyrule and lets you go off and explore.
Characters can give you quests and guidance,¬†¬†
but you can also ignore that stuff entirely and¬†
wander off in a completely different direction.
To make this whole thing work, the¬†
game has a very simple structure.
The final boss - Calamity Ganon - can be¬†
approached at any time after the tutorial.
But you‚Äôll almost certainly fail.
His castle is locked up tight, filled with¬†
environmental hazards and high-level enemies.
So you explore elsewhere - finding new¬†
items, weapons, powers, and skills.
Each dungeon you finish¬†
will weaken the final boss.
And each quest-line you complete will potentially¬†¬†
give you an item that will help¬†
you assault Ganon‚Äôs fortress.
This turns the whole game into a player-directed¬†
quest to prepare for the final showdown.
A Rocky-esque training montage where everything¬†¬†
you do is for that ultimate¬†
goal of vanquishing Ganon.
And this allows for a game about¬†
adventure, exploration, mystery,¬†¬†
and surprise - in a way we haven‚Äôt really¬†
seen since the very first Zelda game.
Breath of the Wild is¬†
available on the Switch eShop.
Fortnite is a cheeky game.
It was supposed to be about building¬†
fortifications to protect your team from zombies.
But when Epic saw PlayerUnknown‚Äôs¬†
Battlegrounds - an addictive Battle¬†¬†
Royale showdown between 100 players - they were¬†
like, actually, yeah, let‚Äôs do that instead.
Like I say: it‚Äôs cheeky.
But this is also Fortnite‚Äôs strength.
The developers have always been willing¬†
to rethink key aspects of the game.
Major mechanics have changed.
The infamous building gameplay is now optional.
And with every season, which lasts a few¬†
months, the game introduces radical new¬†¬†
changes like fresh weapons, vehicles,¬†
movement mechanics, and characters.
Plus, the all-important world map has been¬†
destroyed and remade several times over.
Basically: if you don‚Äôt play Fortnite for a while,¬†¬†
it‚Äôs like trying a whole new¬†
game when you play it next.
Fortnite‚Äôs frequent reinvention is probably¬†
not sustainable for most studios - in fact,¬†¬†
it doesn‚Äôt sound like it‚Äôs sustainable for¬†
Epic - but it‚Äôs an incredible example of¬†¬†
how constantly changing content can¬†
keep a game feel fresh and exciting.
Fortnite is available everywhere.
Bennett Foddy has built a¬†
career on pissing off players,¬†¬†
with punishing games built¬†
around absurd control schemes.
Like QWOP - a game where you independently control¬†¬†
an olympic sprinter‚Äôs thighs and¬†
calves with four keyboard keys.
His magnum opus, though, is Getting Over It¬†
- a game about a bald bloke in a cauldron who¬†¬†
uses a sledgehammer as a sort of climber‚Äôs¬†
pick to ascend an impossibly-high mountain.
You have to use an awkward¬†
set of unconventional mouse¬†¬†
movements to grab, push, and pull your way higher.
And if you fall‚Ä¶ you fall.
The mountain is a single, continuous level,¬†
and there no checkpoints or save rooms.
So you can be almost at the summit and then¬†
fall all the way down to the very bottom.
This feels, somehow, even worse than dying in an¬†
old NES game and being sent back to level one.
The game is a loving throwback to those old games.
From a time where failures were punished,¬†
and successes felt truly earned.
After years of games with smooth edges and¬†
ample handholding, the only help you‚Äôll¬†¬†
get in Getting Over It is Bennett Foddy‚Äôs¬†
encouragement via a philosophical voice over.
The game‚Äôs on Steam. Play it if you dare.
Monolith‚Äôs Middle-Earth games remain as some¬†¬†
of the most ambitious entries in¬†
the world of big budget gaming.
Because Shadow of War might look like yet another¬†
open world romp with stealth, skill trees,¬†¬†
and flashy combat - but soon enough, you‚Äôll¬†
realise that there‚Äôs more going on under the hood.
Basically: among the cannon fodder¬†
enemies you‚Äôll find orc captains.
Each one has a name, a voice, a set of skills,¬†
and - most importantly - a memory of the player.
So if you run away from battle, they might pop¬†
up half an hour later and call you a coward.
And if you burn them to death,¬†
they might miraculously show up¬†¬†
next play session with a sack on¬†
their head and a score to settle.
This so-called nemesis system creates truly¬†
memorable stories with multiple different orcs.
Maybe there‚Äôs the guy who just won‚Äôt die,¬†
the dude who always refuses to finish you¬†¬†
off when you fail, or the annoying dude¬†
who can‚Äôt stop singing throughout battle.
Crucially, these stories are completely¬†
unique to each player - entirely based¬†¬†
on which orcs are randomly generated,¬†
and how they respond to your gameplay.
This sort of emergent storytelling is¬†
usually the stuff of experimental indie¬†¬†
games - but it‚Äôs here, in a triple¬†
A console game with a Hollywood IP.
You don‚Äôt see them like this very often.
Shadow of War is on Steam, Xbox, and PlayStation.
Among Us is the perfect example¬†
of a social deduction game.
A game where one or more players¬†
are secretly trying to sabotage¬†¬†
the mission - and the other¬†
players have to weed them out.
So most of the players in an Among Us game¬†
are trying to keep a spaceship running by¬†¬†
doing little mini-games and other such tasks.
But a select few are imposters and are¬†
trying to secretly murder their friends.
At any point, a player can trigger a meeting¬†
and accuse someone of being an imposter.
So Among Us becomes a game¬†
about deceit and deception.
About evidence, collaboration, and voting.
If you all decide to vote someone off of¬†
the spaceship you‚Äôll immediately see if¬†¬†
they were a dastardly imposter‚Ä¶¬†
or a fellow crew-mate. Whoops!
Among Us - and the card games that¬†
inspired it - encourage all sorts¬†¬†
of wild social dynamics that you don‚Äôt¬†
normally get to use in the real world.
And because the game is more¬†
about the people you play with,¬†¬†
than the game itself, it‚Äôs¬†
almost infinitely enjoyable.
Among Us is available on all platforms.
Celeste is a game about overcoming¬†
anxiety and cutting yourself some slack.
So it‚Äôs perhaps no surprise that this challenging¬†¬†
platformer is a poster child¬†
for being kind to the player.
To start, it comes via the controls themselves.
Madeline‚Äôs massive movement script¬†
is packed with little tweaks that¬†¬†
are designed to subtly help the player.
For instance - coyote time means that you can¬†
jump, even if you‚Äôve already run off the edge¬†¬†
of a platform, to ensure that players don‚Äôt need¬†
pixel perfect precision when inputting commands.
All of these little grace mechanics are there to¬†¬†
permit the player‚Äôs intention¬†
- if not their exact inputs.
And it leads to a game that just feels¬†
fluid and responsive - and never punitive.
Though, that certainly doesn‚Äôt make for¬†
an easy game - Celeste is a ruthlessly¬†¬†
punishing platformer that takes delight¬†
in counting the number of times you died.
But help is available if you can‚Äôt do it.
The game comes with an assist mode that‚Äôs¬†
packed with useful accessibility options - and¬†¬†
outright cheat codes - to make the game easier.
Celeste came out at the height of a¬†
debate around whether it was suitable¬†¬†
for intentionally hard games to include¬†
easy modes and accessibility options.
Celeste‚Äôs galaxy brain solution:¬†¬†
just tell the player what the game is¬†
about and why these features exist.
Funnily enough: most players get it and don‚Äôt need¬†
to turn on assist mode unless they really need it.
Celeste is available on every platform.
Rimworld is a story generator.
I mean, it‚Äôs also a survival game about¬†
trying to manage a colony of people.
But the point of the game is¬†
to generate an interesting,¬†¬†
emergent, and often chaotic narrative.
It partly does this through a mishmash of¬†
loads of different systems, which can all¬†¬†
smush up next to each other and create¬†
interesting - and unexpected - effects.
The usual sort of emergent storytelling¬†
we might see in highly systematic games.
But the game also takes a more direct approach,¬†
with an ""AI storyteller"" that keeps track of¬†¬†
the colony‚Äôs current situation, and then picks¬†
events based on what would be most interesting.
This makes for a game full of truly unique and¬†
personal storytelling moments - making it an¬†¬†
essential play for anyone interested in the¬†
way games can generate and curate narratives.
Rimworld is on Steam, PlayStation, and Xbox.
Florence tells the tale of a young¬†
woman and her first true love,¬†¬†
through a montage of tiny mini games.
These range from brushing your teeth to¬†
eating meals to shaking polaroid pictures.
And they‚Äôre achieved through¬†
really simple controls,¬†¬†
like taps and tickles of the touchscreen.
But there‚Äôs a deeper level here, as developer¬†
Mountain uses your interaction with these¬†¬†
minigames as a metaphor, to express the¬†
feeling of performing these actions.
Like, when Florence‚Äôs new¬†
boyfriend Kish reveals his dreams,¬†¬†
you scrape away at the surface with your¬†
finger to reveal the image underneath.
And when Florence pushes¬†
Kish to follow that dream,¬†¬†
you physically push him from one¬†
side of the screen to the other.
The best example, though, has¬†
to be the conversation system,¬†¬†
where speech bubbles are¬†
created from puzzle pieces.
The way you put those words together tells¬†¬†
you everything you need to know about how¬†
well Florence and Kish are communicating.
Lead designer Ken Wong said ""For a level to work,¬†¬†
it needs to have an interesting interaction¬†
that evokes a feeling or tells a story.
The feeling or story has to come from¬†
the interactions, not from the images"".
Florence is available on¬†
mobile, Steam, and Switch.
It seems perfectly natural that you shouldn‚Äôt¬†
know what your enemies are thinking.
And so we‚Äôve had decades of strategy games¬†¬†
built around the idea of preparing for¬†
whatever your opponent might do next.
But what would happen if the enemies¬†
actually telegraphed their exact intentions?
That‚Äôs the idea at the heart of Into the¬†
Breach: a tightly-designed tactics game¬†¬†
where you know what your foes will do on¬†
their next turn, and can plan around it.
So not only can you kill an enemy before¬†
they destroy some vital infrastructure,¬†¬†
or dodge out of the way of an incoming attack,¬†¬†
but you can actually push one enemy¬†
into the path of another enemy‚Äôs attack.
This turns the game into an elegant puzzle game¬†¬†
where you can figure out the optimum way¬†
to turn your enemies against themselves.
Randomness and information are two things that¬†
game designers have to think about carefully.
And Into the Breach is an excellent¬†
example of what happens when almost¬†¬†
nothing is left up to chance, and almost¬†
everything is shown to the player.
It‚Äôs on Steam, consoles, and mobile¬†
if you‚Äôve got a Netflix account.
So Slay the Spire is definitely not¬†
the first game to hit on the idea of¬†¬†
synergies - they‚Äôve been part of games,¬†
and especially card games, for decades.
But few titles have done the idea¬†
with such elegance and success.
The game is a deck-building dungeon battler where¬†
you slowly add more and more cards to your deck.
And it doesn‚Äôt take long to realise that certain¬†
cards can work in tandem with each other.
Perhaps one card poisons your enemy, and another¬†
card deals extra damage to a poisoned enemy.
Suddenly, strategies start to emerge.
Ideas, plans, and tactics.
You start to sculpt your deck - buying cards and¬†¬†
passive buffs called relics -¬†
to make this strategy happen.
And when it pays off - when¬†
you‚Äôve built a deck that can¬†¬†
do crazy combinatorial damage numbers to¬†
every enemy you see, it feels amazing.
Like you‚Äôve broken the game¬†
and ripped apart the code.
In other genres, such game-breaking strategies¬†¬†
would be patched out as soon¬†
as the instructions hit Reddit.
But they work fine in a roguelike:¬†
the game is so random that you can¬†¬†
never guarantee that you‚Äôll¬†
find a certain card or relic.
Slay the Spire is available¬†
on all major platforms.
""How much do my choices really¬†
matter?"" It‚Äôs a question that‚Äôs¬†¬†
often asked of games with decisions,¬†
dialogue trees, and branching paths.
Are my choices going to cause huge waves that¬†
irrevocably shift the narrative - or tiny ripples?
It‚Äôs a fair question.
But games like Disco Elysium prove that even¬†¬†
small choices can be impactful¬†
and memorable when done right.
In this game - a sprawling, novelistic,¬†¬†
combat-free RPG - all players will end¬†
up following largely the same story.
There are no big branching¬†
paths or multiple endings.
But despite this, the game is¬†
constantly keeping track of what¬†¬†
you do - and then referencing¬†
your choices and decisions.
If you run everywhere, your¬†
partner will comment on that.
If you‚Äôre an arsehole to certain¬†
characters, they‚Äôll remember that.
If you walk around in your underwear,¬†
characters will have something to say.
And my favourite part of the game happens near¬†
the end, where some of the main characters¬†¬†
come together to discuss your journey, and¬†
make note of your actions, and decisions.
ZA/UM writer Justin Keenan calls this¬†
micro-reactivity and says when it works,¬†¬†
""it's probably the closest an RPG can come¬†
to replicating the tabletop experience of¬†¬†
having a very good dungeon master¬†
sitting across from you listening¬†¬†
to you and responding to your most¬†
idiosyncratic choices as a player"".
Disco Elysium is available on¬†
all platforms as The Final Cut.
A little while back, I described¬†
Her Story as an information game:¬†¬†
a type of game where everything¬†
is available to you - but you¬†¬†
can only decipher it by asking the right¬†
questions and following the correct leads.
Outer Wilds is like that but¬†
instead of a PC database,¬†¬†
it takes place in an entire¬†
simulated solar system.
This time loop adventure asks you to figure¬†
out why the sun will explode after 22 minutes.
And so you‚Äôll need to hop between¬†
planets - like a watery giant and¬†¬†
a pair of sand-swapping hourglass¬†
planets - to figure out the secret.
Again: your progress is not halted¬†
by combat or unlockable abilities,¬†¬†
but simply your understanding of the world.
Each planet hides clues that will help you to¬†
uncover new areas on the other celestial bodies.
By following these leads, and zig-zagging across¬†
the solar system, you‚Äôll slowly uncover the truth.
And hopefully put a stop to that¬†
whole annoying supernova thing.
Designer Alex Beachum says he wanted¬†
to ""create a world that constantly¬†¬†
makes references to things players¬†
can actually go out and discover"",¬†¬†
which leads to a satisfying¬†
loop of exploring and learning.
Outer Wilds is available on all major platforms.
Here‚Äôs a hot take - the most interesting thing¬†
about virtual reality is not the headset.
Seeing a world in 360 degrees is¬†
certainly amazing, but in my opinion,¬†¬†
there‚Äôs more excitement to¬†
be found in the controllers.
These things let you reach out into full 3D space,¬†¬†
and they track the exact movement of¬†
your hands - and even your fingers.
So take‚Ä¶ any firefight in Half-Life: Alyx.
The set-up is the same as any other shooter - but¬†¬†
the controls lead to emergent gameplay¬†
that I‚Äôve never had in a classic FPS.
Like‚Ä¶ being able to crack open a door¬†
a few inches, and poke my gun through,¬†¬†
to blast at head crabs from relative safely.
Or fumbling to reload a gun, and¬†
dropping the bullets all over the floor,¬†¬†
in the middle of a frantic firefight.
Or reflexively grabbing an object and¬†
holding it up to bat away a lunging enemy.
These aren‚Äôt game mechanics, in¬†
the traditional sense - these are¬†¬†
just natural outcomes of having a world that¬†
allows for completely freeform interaction.
It sometimes feels like VR is going¬†
to crack open a whole new paradigm¬†¬†
for how we interact with games - and¬†
we‚Äôre truly only at the beginning.
Half-Life: Alyx is available on Steam, but¬†
naturally requires some kind of VR headset.
Inscryption is more than just a¬†
good deck-building card battler.
It‚Äôs a whole experience - a game where¬†
you think you‚Äôve reached the end,¬†¬†
only to realise that you‚Äôve¬†
merely scratched the surface.
Inscryption - much like the other¬†
games designed by Daniel Mullins - is¬†¬†
a meta-textual horror game that keeps¬†
unfolding in different and surprising ways.
The game mixes genres, art styles,¬†
and storytelling methods and jumps¬†¬†
between the game itself, and a whole¬†
fictional world that surrounds the game.
It‚Äôs game within a game, within a game.
And there‚Äôs even more to find in the real world as¬†¬†
the deepest lore can only be found in¬†
an ARG experience outside of the game.
If this all sounds maddeningly vague,¬†¬†
it‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt want to spoil¬†
the game‚Äôs greatest delights.
So play Inscryption to learn more¬†
about how games can revel in mystery,¬†¬†
surprise, and keeping the player guessing.
It‚Äôs available on all four platforms.
Much earlier in this video -¬†
and hello if you‚Äôre still here,¬†¬†
thanks for hanging in there - I talked¬†
about the joys of levelling up in Diablo II.
You kill monsters, unlock more powerful¬†
skills, and then kill more monsters.
It‚Äôs a wonderfully addictive loop.
But what if we simplify it? Boil¬†
it down to its purest essence.
Well then we get‚Ä¶ Vampire Survivors.
In this game, the character¬†
automatically attacks and so¬†¬†
all you have to do is navigate near¬†
to enemies and wait for them to die.
Killing enemies nets experience points which¬†
can be spent on new, or more powerful attacks.
Some attacks can also power each other up,¬†
creating synergistic combos that do more damage.
And that‚Äôs‚Ä¶ kinda it.
You just wiggle around and watch enemies die.
And yet, it‚Äôs hard to put down.
Like, really hard.
So by taking the most potent bits from¬†
Diablo, Geometry Wars, Cookie Clicker,¬†¬†
and Slay the Spire, we get a game that can¬†
hold players in a powerful, vice-like grip.
Is that good? That‚Äôs up to you.
But Vampire Survivors holds lots of¬†
lessons about how to keep players engaged.
The game is available on all four platforms.
Tunic has some of the most¬†
satisfying secrets in all of gaming.
They are oftentimes esoteric and cryptic¬†
- but you‚Äôre also subtly pushed into¬†¬†
solving them for yourself, rather than¬†
reading up about them on a subreddit.
Most of the secrets come down to a simple idea:¬†
everything is right in front of your eyes.
The things you need to solve Tunic‚Äôs riddles are¬†¬†
right there in the world - but¬†
you just don‚Äôt realise it yet.
You don‚Äôt understand their meaning,¬†
or how to use or activate them.
It‚Äôs only later - usually when you stumble upon¬†¬†
one of the game‚Äôs instruction¬†
manual pages - that you get it.
And you get that rush of excitement¬†
and realisation as you now get how¬†¬†
to open that door, reach that treasure¬†
chest, or read that cryptic language.
Mind you: Tunic never forces this onto players.
It‚Äôs entirely possible to¬†
ignore all of these secrets,¬†¬†
treat it like a cute action game, and finish the¬†
whole thing without really engaging your brain.
But it‚Äôs almost impossible to not¬†
take the bait, follow a thread,¬†¬†
and get wrapped up in the game‚Äôs mysteries.
Tunic is available on all platforms.
And so we come to our final game,¬†
which brings us bang up to date - or,¬†¬†
more accurately, into the future as this¬†
game is technically not fully released.
Shadows of Doubt is a detective¬†
simulator that‚Äôs still in early access,¬†¬†
but well worth playing to show you what¬†
can be achieved with procedural generation.
Because this game takes place¬†
in a small city block filled¬†¬†
with hundreds of citizens who¬†
are all randomly generated.
They have random jobs, homes, partners,¬†
blood types, fingerprints, and so on.
They have daily schedules, bespoke¬†
motivations, and - most importantly,¬†¬†
for the game‚Äôs fantasy - a sudden desire¬†
to go off and murder a fellow citizen.
What follows next is a brilliant detective¬†
game of looking for clues, following leads,¬†¬†
and putting all your notes on a crazy¬†
corkboard, complete with pins and red thread.
But the procedural generation is¬†
what I think you should focus on,¬†¬†
because its this crazy complex system that allows¬†
for an infinite number of murders and missions,¬†¬†
with stories that feel completely¬†
personal to each budding detective.
Games certainly don‚Äôt have to be filled¬†
with complex systems - in fact, some of¬†¬†
the titles on this list are fantastic because¬†
they focus on sheer simplicity and elegance.
But Shadows of Doubt shows what you can¬†
make when you let the algorithm take over.
It‚Äôs on Steam, in early access.
So. There we have it.
Over the last 100 games, we've gone¬†
from the arcades to virtual reality.
We've gone from generating simple¬†
dungeons to generating entire city blocks.
We've seen genres being born, and we've¬†
seen trends emerge, change, and die off.
And even with 100 games, this is¬†
still a tiny, weenie slice of the pie.
I could happily pick another 100¬†
games and I still wouldn't be done.
And this is just video games, after all.
There's just as much to be¬†
learned from card games,¬†¬†
and board games, and tabletop roleplaying games.
And when you're done with all¬†
of that, play even more games.
Play game jam games, and experimental games,¬†¬†
and art games, and serious¬†
games, and educational games.
And every time you play a new¬†
game, think about how it worked,¬†¬†
and how you can apply those lessons¬†
to the games you make going forward.
Please do let me know all of the games I¬†
forgot about in the comments down below.
You can also get this list¬†
on the website backlogged¬†¬†
if you want to tick off the games you've played.
And who knows, maybe I'll be back in¬†
another 10 years with another 100 games.
We'll see. Until then, thank¬†
you so much for watching.",""

right here we go it's waffle time oh
jeez waffle there's two eliminations
left I'm so sorry we're looking for one
more this will be the decider of oh you
are the top 15 and moving on to the next
round Li it's up to you somebody just
had to sit here and watch a bunch of
people shoot arrows for the past like 30
minutes and now you're going to tell
them that they just wasted their time
there are some people who need the money
but there are some people here that make
enough money that this doesn't really
mattero you don't need this
money wa oh my gosh that was pretty
toxic oh oh my god dude well as you can
tell new teams you guys are officially
in three teams of five this next
challenge is a game of protect the
president last team standing wins if
your president dies you are done we're
looking for one set of five people to
move on for the chance of $10,000 have
you decided on a uh president I would
like to volunteer as president I'm also
confident that I can do this for my
team you may begin now waffles Bridge
hold down grouch and just go all right
well green team already started building
do you think I can go for a long shot
not even close I just wasted an arrow
Red's towering across oh and they're
scared of the arrows they're not doing
anything still okay I'm going to keep
going diagonal they are bridging towards
us I'm thing wait so you guys are moving
towards the Green Team what's the plan
there well they look kind of like less
threatening than red oh you oh you guys
are trying to just wipe them maybe we'll
see what happens go go go go go go mid
all right blue officially took over the
middle I feel like that might be
literally the Strat to be honest okay we
have mid control but the thing is they
are definitely going to come in on us
keep in mind guys at some point in time
if there's no confrontation I will take
matters in my own hands and the results
will be obvious very very quickly at
this point maybe we start even working
our way over to Green because we both
have to push at the same time or we're
both dead all right so red is coming
this way officially all three teams are
not even on their base anymore yeah
we're waiting for them to get in range
because if we shoot too early we just
waste arrows and they hide the president
derer can you go behind a a thing you
know we don't we don't need you getting
shot oh we're not here to fight no guys
stop stop they just said they're not
here to fight they just said they're not
here to fight I have not missed oh you
haven't missed no oh whoopsie oh my
Sushi oh no wait so what's the plan uh
we're going to go have a diplomatic
discussion with green and try to figure
this out and maybe stab some people you
got your wish Carl what was my wish
murder woo okay they're both closing in
on us all right everyone everyone I hit
the president I hit the president I'm on
one heart oh my God duper duper is one
heart I can no longer help you good luck
can you give us your arrows I have none
good luck green can you guys hear me
guys we need to both go into the middle
together okay that's a good point truce
to get to Mid I think they're
negotiating dude this is bad they might
be but they are both low like if you one
tap the president on both sides they'll
die it's coming down to it green is
going in all right so are we going to
bridge together is that the plan right
now yes the red team president literally
is one heart the Green Team would have
to do one swing to take every single
member of the red team out we need to
push from multiple sides so that they we
don't we don't risk oh I'm dead no
no damn the first elimination but it was
not a president blue how are you feeling
uh pretty nervous it literally just
takes one person swinging a sword over
there and then you guys have a
substantial Advantage yeah I heard one
of them one of the presidents down to
two hearts and then I think green is six
do does the Green Team know that red
team knows that Green's at six hearts
but I don't think Green Team knows that
red is at 1 and a half can you build a
tunnel I'm trying to get to Li the red
person was in the open and if he takes
one hit that's game he's in the open
right now thank you thank you I was
waiting I was waiting sced sushi that
was awesome okay regroup regroup blue
regroup I don't want Rift to like just
be by himself over here this might come
down to it this might be the final
battle hit one oh no no
no no waffles has now been eliminated
you sick twisted people it's time to
shrink the border to the center good
luck I might try and get behind them
everyone let's say one you know final
word Al together just in case dude look
at this look at this we can do this
remember try to keep me alive but also
try to kill their president he only has
a heart and a half but if he can get any
damage this will be big are you guys
ready yes thr
muffles no go together Stay Together
stay together oh there's someone there

pressure things I've ever done in
Minecraft for the final five it's a
simple game of hot potato there will be
a hot potato placed randomly amongst one
of you you guys will have 90 seconds to

one I Su let's go let's go foxy I need
you to know something he was IM
absolutely going to hit you but he got
stuck on the ladder right there that was
the craziest thing I've ever seen in my
entire life I can't believe that just
happened oh my goodness whatever happens
I'm I'm proud of us we did kid me too
and then there were two libl and foxley
you guys are going to hate each other
after this let's go you guys feel like
you could trust each other pretty well
yeah yeah cuz for the final 1 V one it's
time for a simple game of split or steal
for the
$110,000 no oh in Split or steal you
guys have two options if both of you
pick split then you each end with $5,000
but if one of you picks steel that
person gets 10,000 and the other person
gets absolutely nothing but if both of
you pick steel nobody gets anything take
your time do you guys have anything you
guys want to say to each other you're
the only person I would want to be here
with
I I trust you I trust you I'm so down to
split I don't need that I was already
going to tell you I will give you 3K if
I want I don't care well really quick
guys let's talk about it liby for the
sake of it if you won what would you do
with the money I would go to California
to see my brother foxley hypothetically
you click steal you win the $10,000 what
would you spend it on I also have a
puppy who has had like heart issues
since she was born so the bills be quite
a lot of money fair enough it's about
time to make the decision huh okay okay
libl foxley is very far away right now
foxley cannot hear you on the other side
of that wall tell me what's going
through your head $10,000 can not just
let me be able to see my brother I will
be able to afford and go to college end
of the day you don't really know this
person that well I mean you literally
just met them over Minecraft I know
there's the chance that foxley's also
thinking the same thing I know you have
a decision made my decision's made I
need to see my brother all right foxley
y he cannot hear you over there tell me
what is actually on your mind cuz you
guys were very gung-ho both of you guys
about splitting but I want to know I
mean I have known leapley for a while I
trust him but I don't know it's a
difficult decision cuz I don't want to
betray someone I trust but then again I
could have it all to myself $10,000 is a
lot of money it's almost exactly double
$5,000 yeah exactly foxley would you you
blame him if he decided to click steel I
would be very disappointed cuz it might
end up in the situation where neither of
us get the money so it's a risk do you
think then that you might actually pick
steel I don't know yet I'll have to
think about it okay foxley all right
guys well you can now go in your chest
the green means you will be splitting
and the red means you are opting in to
steal I want you to make a decision
whenever you guys make your decision on
the count of three I'm going to tell you
guys to put the block on the gold block
$10,000 is so much money though again I
could take all of the money from myself
all
$10,000 stealing is 10,000 or nothing
all right do you guys feel good I know
what I have to do I'm ready I'm ready
you can now
Place 3 2 1 reveal let's go oh my gosh
you guys both split congrats liy and
Oxley you just won five grand each",""

confusing on third down to couple Caleb
Williams trying to find somewhere to go
short toss to
Swift
he did not get
[Applause]
it third down and five now darnold in
trouble backs up able to get away throws
incomplete and a good job by this Bears
defense the rookie will rard will try
from
52 and
hit and GLE coming off the
edge DeAndre Swift Out of the Back Field
makes the catch and gets about 10 even
Sam darnold's class when you've got
Lamar Jackson and Baker Mayfield and
it's kind of the nature of the Beast
here's a
Dun nice drive being put together as the
Bears get another first
down look at all the Defenders up by the
line of scrimmage Williams is hit and
the ball is out picked up by Cashman
knocked down at the
39 and for Caleb his fourth lost of the
season and for the second consecutive
possession
the Vikings start at the Chicago 39 it's
going to be second and
one they'll put Jaylen Johnson over here
to Justin Jefferson's side throughout
the night Jones right up the Middle with
a first down spins to the
16 they were really good down here in
the Red Zone limiting the touchdowns of
Minnesota so be key again tonight play
action from darnold Endzone touchdown
Jeffers
[Applause]
well Minnesota goes Hard Play Fake with
Sam darnold and you see the impact in
that it has here on the safety Kevin
byard and then you've got receiver
coming in behind it and just allows him
a lot of
flexibility foran Rush Williams steps up
and the pass broken up Smith flashed in
there and made the play
Jaa Griffin in coverage on a Dun be
careful with the football and try to get
as much out of this as you can for field
position this one is caught by Jones
Aaron
Jones is going to
reach and be very close to first down
yardage you've talked about trying to
create a rockar in the quarterback
position how much of a rockar is Sam
darell playing right he playing so great
I mean even right there third and extra
long instead of trying to Line Drive
Ball third down and 10 darnold complete
first
down Brandon Powell makes that catch his
first to the N some of the things that
we see here from the Minnesota Vikings
as well as the Los Angeles Rams watching
those teams Blitz coming Vikings able to
pick it up darnold finds his man catch
made by Addison
darnold is in trouble has to just heave
it and he's
picked intercepted by Tyreek
Stevenson with the job up front by the
offensive line a lot of three rushers in
his Lanes here's another nice game that
is the 16th run of this first half by
Chicago play action from Will Willams
looking for KT he's got him after KT
leaks out and Cole KT with a nice catch
and run takes it inside the 40 for
14 third down and 15 DJ Moore needs
blocks and DJ nice gain on Third and 15
got
14 Swift gets hit in the back field and
then
fights he didn't get it
it's another stop for this Vikings
defense on another fourth and one carry
by DeAndre
Swift Packers look so good last
night darnold finds Jefferson on second
and
12 Extra Man On The Rush darnold lets it
Fly he's got a first down catch made by
hackinson
darnold is the leader of the group and
he finds hackinson near
side would probably be the less thrilled
about that room would be Sam darnold and
yet he loves it best room he said he's
had in his career What A Catch by
Addison as he's able to hang on got the
big hit from by and somehow hung on
meanwhile and so Jaylen Johnson is now
at the top of the
screen darnold underneath hackinson
is got a first
down another third and long picked up by
the Vikings as by made the tackle but
too
[Applause]
late End Zone
shot hackinson the closest one to it 8
seconds left it's Fourth
Down second game back from being on IR
with a quad injury and he drills
it and and it's a 13 to nothing game
Minnesota on
top this is a big learning year for him
in knowing what he has to know better
going into a sophomore year here's Allen
good
throw ball comes out Allen found a void
in the secondary and it's a completion
the the timing is just very natural in
that regard bad throw open wide open was
Keenan Allen and Caleb Williams missed
it wouldn't have I would have been an
undrafted free agent
or I would have canceled the workout
unlike Sam here's one
thrown what an effort by Kyler Gordon
but he's out of
[Applause]
bounds what a free play Renard came
across and with the free play there's ad
dun inside the
30 the problem has simply been they just
have not connected and a swift nice move
and DeAndre is going to get 10
plus not had a lot of holes for the most
part to run
through here he is again gets to the
edge got a block from DJ Moore down to
the one yeah that's that's good run
that's good tough running he's got the
speed to get to the
[Applause]
edge Williams hangs on to it throws
incomplete
plate well there's been a lot of
Conversation Over the last weeks second
down at
16
hackinson good move third down coming up
Baker's probably sitting on the couch
drinking a cold beer right now just
rubbing his belly or something you
know Aaron Jones nice hole this time
and Aaron gets about eight and a
half toss to Jones Cuts back nice carry
for a first down inside the
20 in Sunday NFL Countdown second and 11
over the middle Jefferson down to the
one strong catch in traffic
Jones gets him in touchdown
[Applause]
Minnesota well Trent sherfield right
here and then Brian O'Neal these are the
two guys that do a good job sherfield
does enough signed off greenbase
practice squad he's been with the team
had nine snaps last week he'll get more
playing time to finish out this year on
First and five Swift is able to drive
for a first
down now they haven't blitzed as much as
they typically do against Caleb Williams
tonight DJ Moore on first down able to
get
[Applause]
nine
Williams is able to find Allen who stays
in for the catch
third down and
16
Williams trying to make something
happened jumping
around going backward and just up for
grabs flag flies and the pass incomplet
they got Caleb down he took a big time
hit at the end of that
play snap was high the kick is
good and I say it just depends you just
can't let the guy lose confidence if he
plays early here's Jefferson catch and
run to the Chicago
49 they get right back on the line on
first
down Jefferson diving
catch he had a big year last year got
the new contract and he's had a good
year this year also darnold enzone
Addison contact and a flag
here's
Acres driving for the
touchdown I think it was Tyreek
Stevenson who had a chance and he's a
physical player in the Run game he's
just not quite able to square him up and
you
got which is the first step for any
organization to be able to compete
within the division third down and three
William
sack Dallas Turner King King but there's
Caleb Williams to develop and then
everybody else third down and eight boy
shot out of a cannon for the sack is TJ
[Applause]
Edwards fourth down and 16 and a block
Ryan Wright has it
blocked second down Williams trying to
find somewhere to go back across his
body and across the field to Keenan
Allen first
down it doesn't look now he might bring
five but he's not bringing all out Blitz
like I thought he
might got to convert and Zone there it
is touchdown
Allen and a fast ball from Caleb
Williams got down and they were under
two minutes and 11 points and they
needed to get the touchdown and same
situation here fourth down and there's
there's more likelihood than as a
quarterback Caleb Endzone broken up DJ
Moore the Target and the two-point try
fails
because this is a great profession when
you're winning and playing like he
is here's sherfield nice effort and he's
able to pick up the first
down storyline in this one
handoff is to
Chandler on third down and 10 bears are
out of timeouts and he knows how
important the position is and and all
the things that I've talked about he
certainly understands and knows and
knows how to go about complemented it
all and and we've seen
[Applause]
it
Homer his Odyssey will end right there
and so will all of
ours that'll do it Vikings have won
seven straight Justin Jefferson and crew
with shout outs all night to the Hall of
Famer Randy
Moss Minnesota goes to 12 and two on the
year",""

can't let the guy lose confidence if he
plays early here's Jefferson catch and
run to the Chicago
49 they get right back on the line on
first
down Jefferson diving
catch he had a big year last year got
the new contract and he's had a good
year this year also darnold enzone
Addison contact and a flag
here's
Acres driving for the
touchdown I think it was Tyreek
Stevenson who had a chance and he's a
physical player in the Run game he's
just not quite able to square him up and
you
got which is the first step for any
organization to be able to compete
within the division third down and three
William
sack Dallas Turner King King but there's
Caleb Williams to develop and then
everybody else third down and eight boy
shot out of a cannon for the sack is TJ
[Applause]
Edwards fourth down and 16 and a block
Ryan Wright has it
blocked second down Williams trying to
find somewhere to go back across his
body and across the field to Keenan
Allen first
down it doesn't look now he might bring
five but he's not bringing all out Blitz
like I thought he
might got to convert and Zone there it
is touchdown
Allen and a fast ball from Caleb
Williams got down and they were under
two minutes and 11 points and they
needed to get the touchdown and same
situation here fourth down and there's
there's more likelihood than as a
quarterback Caleb Endzone broken up DJ
Moore the Target and the two-point try
fails
because this is a great profession when
you're winning and playing like he
is here's sherfield nice effort and he's
able to pick up the first
down storyline in this one
handoff is to
Chandler on third down and 10 bears are
out of timeouts and he knows how
important the position is and and all
the things that I've talked about he
certainly understands and knows and
knows how to go about complemented it
all and and we've seen
[Applause]
it
Homer his Odyssey will end right there
and so will all of
ours that'll do it Vikings have won
seven straight Justin Jefferson and crew
with shout outs all night to the Hall of
Famer Randy
Moss Minnesota goes to 12 and two on the

- [Falcon] Games of days
past, we tend to forget about,
but there's certain ones that
make sense to go back to.
Hi folks, it's Falcon
and today on ""Gameranx"",
let's talk about those.
Here's 10 single player
games to return to in 2024.
Starting off with number
10, it's ""Days Gone"".
Now, I was gonna start
this off with a eulogy
for the late, great Bend Studios,
the guys behind this game,
but that actually is a little premature.
They're still around,
maybe on live support,
but they're still alive
and apparently working
on a live service AAA game
set in a new universe.
Good luck with that, guys.
But I would prefer we
just got ""Days Gone"" II.
The original didn't get
great reviews back in 2019
and it was mostly greeted
with a shrug by Sony fans.
But in the past few years,
its overall reputation
has shifted from generally negative
to surprisingly positive.
I mean, look at the Steam
reviews, it's very positive.
The thing about ""Days Gone""
is it's one of those games
that, it's an easy
punching bag for critics,
it's an untested IP without
a built-in fan base.
It's not one of Sony's main franchises.
It's not coming from a main Sony studio.
So a lot of people,
reviewers and fans alike,
just didn't give it the time of day.
It didn't launch in the
best condition either.
It was pretty buggy at first,
but that's way less of an issue now.
The thing about ""Days Gone""
is it just doesn't make
the best first impression.
It comes off like a
very generic zombie game
in its opening hours.
The production values,
I mean, they're excellent
right from the start,
but it takes a while to get moving.
It's not the best at the
beginning of this game.
(gun shots sounding)
(zombies vocalizing)
(dramatic music)
(gun shots sounding)
(zombies vocalizing)
It gets way more interesting
and exciting in the back half.
I mean, you don't even engage with one
of the central mechanics of
the game, the zombie hordes,
until you're about a dozen hours in.
That's pretty deep into the
game to hide the main event.
So if you played this
game back when it came out
but you gave up on it due
to bugs or just didn't care
because the story isn't that involved,
now's a good time to come back to it
'cause this is a game
that really does get
better as it goes along.
It's one of those open world games
that I've always had a soft spot for,
but it's really nice to
see the general consensus
change on this one to
something more positive.
At number nine is
""Quantum Break"" from 2016.
I guess people just weren't
ready for what Remedy was doing.
I'll be fair here though,
I'm not sure Remedy was entirely ready
for what they were doing
with this weird ass game.
In 2024, we're in the middle
of the Remedy revolution.
""Control"" was a massive groundbreaking hit
and ""Alan Wake 2"" is perhaps
the pinnacle of the style
they've been working on
for quite a while now.
So everyone's really aware of what's up.
But in 2016, they were
just another developer
making a launch title for Xbox One
and the game they made left
people pretty confused.
It's a narrative-focused
action game with time powers
that also had these long
live action episodes
everyone would play between chapters.
It's ambitious.
It tried to meld Netflix-style
television with a video game
and there's some great ideas
like how certain things you do
in the game affect a TV show,
but it kind of just
amounted to an action game
where you periodically
had to completely stop
and watch a really long cut scene.
It is fun to see Remedy regulars show up
for the first time, though.
Critically, a lot of the characters
actually connect to ""Alan Wake 2"".
Now you could argue that
there are rights issues
or you could argue that they're
alternate world versions,
but Mr Hatch, Mr Door, eh?
- [Game Narrator] Our universe.
We're just a speck of light
floating in an endless ocean of darkness.
(upbeat music)
Every story finds its writer.
(upbeat music)
(wondrous music)
Wake has a bloody knife
and the light of the flashlight,
he smiles in wicked space,
he lies in bloody mess,
eyes staring.
- [Falcon] The parts where you actually
get to use time powers
are a lot of fun, too.
It's definitely lesser
than either ""Control""
or ""Alan Wake 2"", which are
both just fully realized
powerhouse games and they
managed to combine video games
and live action much more seamlessly.
""Quantum Break"" is a flawed game for sure,
and the length of the cut scenes
would make even Kojima envious,
but it's Remedy, and it's got
some of the great set pieces
that you'd expect in a Remedy game
and some of the cliff hangers
might actually get resolved
in the future, even if an
actual sequel is unlikely.
There's just obviously connections
with the ""Real Remedy-connected
universe"" here.
Also, this game's on sale
all the time on Steam, too,
and you can skip the live
action parts if you want.
You have my permission,
just don't tell anybody
I said that, right, okay?
At number eight is ""Warhammer
40k Space Marine"" from 2011.
It's 2024 and somehow ""Warhammer 40k""
is bigger than it's ever been.
The games are all over Steam.
They took over ""Call of Duty"",
Amazon's going all in on
that ""Warhammer"" TV show.
So when an actual sequel of this game
is coming out in late 2024,
there's just no better time
to return to Relic's original
""Warhammer 40k"" action game.
Remember when people used to accuse this
of being a ""Gears of War"" rip off?
Seriously, that was a common
complaint back in 2011.
It just goes to show how
main stream attention
wasn't quite there yet.
What makes this game great
is that it actually isn't
like ""Gears"" at all.
It's an Xbox 360 game
that's not a cover shooter.
It's actually more of a
beat-em-up shooter hybrid
and it's a lot of fun to go back to today.
What makes it work is this
really chunky and powerful combat
that feels just really
tactile in a way few games
have managed to do.
Your Space Marine is an
absolute killing machine
while still feeling really heavy,
but it's not limiting and
it's really satisfying.
(loud battle sounds)
(characters grunting)
Obviously, the story is
generic ""Warhammer 40k"" stuff
and the actual environmental design
leaves plenty to be desired.
But the action in the
game's core, it's excellent
and this game smartly doesn't
overextend its welcome,
only takes about five or so hours to beat,
but they constantly mix things up
with new weapons and enemy types,
so the game manages to
leave you wanting more.
At number seven is
""Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen""
from 2013 post ""Dragon's Dogma 2"",
you might be a little Dragon'ed out,
but even taking that into account,
I think there's enough
about the original game
and especially the updated
re-release ""Dark Arisen""
that make it worth coming back to.
The fact is there's nothing
quite like these games out there.
""Dragon's Dogma"" is a game
that's sort of a lot of things,
but not exactly anything.
There's some ""Skyrim"",
some ""Monster Hunter"",
some ""Dead Rising"",
whole lot more in there.
And while it's not for everybody,
there's definitely some fun to be had.
If you're the type who wants
to play the second game
but can't because of lack of console
and PC that's beefy enough for the sequel,
and at the moment the PC
really needs some beef,
just try playing the first one.
It's cheap, it runs well on most PCs
and honestly, it's more feature-complete
than the sequel is at this point.
It's mostly because ""Dark
Arisen"" has the addition
of Bitter Black Island,
a late game dungeon
full of dangerous monsters
and high-powered loot.
It's probably my favorite
thing in the whole series,
even if it can be brutally difficult.
(dramatic music)
(characters vocalizing)
(dramatic music)
(characters vocalizing)
If you're just finishing the sequel,
then a return to the
original can probably wait.
These games are pretty similar
and you're liable to get burnt out on it,
but for everyone else that's
looking for something,
this is different enough.
It is worth going back to the original
to experience it over again.
At number six is ""Assassin's
Creed Unity"" from 2014.
If you don't love the current direction
of the ""Assassin's Creed"" games
or just wanna experience one
of the most impressive pieces
of virtual tourism ever made,
""Unity"" may be the game for you.
When this came out, it was
absolutely blasted by critics
for bugs, glitches and performance issues,
but more recently the
game's gotten a little bit
of a reevaluation.
Some love it, some people still hate it,
but generally has a much
better reputation now
than it did 10 years ago.
""Unity"" was the last great hurrah
of the old school
""Assassin's Creed"" formula.
It's set in an immaculately
detailed version of Paris
and it lacks a lot of the bloat
later ""Assassin's Creed"" games have.
And in 2024, this game is
in way better of a state
than it was like the original release.
Still needs some work
here and there on PC.
Certain things don't look great
using the standard settings,
but with some tinkering
it can look absolutely stunning, even now.
The lighting is still some
of the best in the business.
They were only able to
make it look this good
by using baked-in lighting.
There is no day night cycle,
but the results speak for themselves
and the city streets have
never looked more accurate
than they did in this game.
The actual story isn't great
and the history's pretty spotty,
even for an ""Assassin's Creed"" game,
but Paris may be the best
looking city they've ever made.
The detail is just astounding.
The actual main sneaking missions
are also really well done
and still hold up very well.
It is a flawed game.
The controls can be a little wonky
and the enemy AI ratchets
between brilliant
and brain dead in an instant.
But I have a lot of respect for this one,
especially if you're sick of
every ""Assassin's Creed"" game
taking a hundred hours to finish.
It will feel like a breath of fresh air.
At number five is
""Spider-Man Web of Shadows"".
You played ""Spider-Man 2""
but still craving some symbiote action?
Well, you really can't go
wrong with ""Web of Shadows"",
a 2008 open world action game
that has some of the
most fun combat systems
ever made for a Spider-Man game.
(characters vocalizing)
After playing through
Insomniac's stunning re-creation
of New York, Shaba Games' threadbare city
is gonna look like total garbage.
Like the visuals were pretty
outdated even back in 2010,
but that's not why you want
to come back to this game.
There's a lot to like here.
Being able to switch between regular
and symbiote suit Spider-Man
on the fly is a great mechanic
'cause both have different
complete move sets.
With the right hands, you
can pull off some amazing
combat stunts in this game,
build up crazy combos,
it's super entertaining.
(battle sounds)
And it doesn't waste any time.
It gets to the good stuff
with nonstop action gameplay
and boss battles that constantly
propel the story forward.
Production values are not great,
like ""Red Dead Redemption""
came out the same year
and compare these things,
well, you get the point, right?
It runs well enough though
and it's a lot of fun to play.
Some even prefer it to
the Insomniac games.
They're absolutely nuts, obviously.
But ""Web of Shadows"" is still,
it's a banger, it's great.
If you've never played this one before,
I will say Peter Parker is the whiniest
he's ever been in any media at all.
- [Spider-man] Where's
Cage and his search party?
- [Agent] Who?
- [Spider-man] The civilian volunteers!
Pretty redhead, arm in a cast.
You are no help!
- [Agent] PC, we got vehicles inbound.
- [Spider-man] MJ!
- [Falcon] But if you get past
his screeching voice acting,
you've gotten through the worst of it.
At number four is ""Deus
Ex Mankind Divided"".
Well, with the rug
pulled out from under us,
we might as well go back to the classics.
The ongoing fallout from the
whole Embrace Group debacle
may have robbed us of an
actual Deus Ex sequel,
but it gives us time to go back
and appreciate what we had.
The thing about ""Mankind Divided""
is it got a lot of complaints back in 2016
and they're all pretty valid, still.
It really does feel like
you're playing half a game.
It's a good half a game, though.
The whole cyborg equals racism thing
isn't handled super well.
Story never really gets
a chance to go anywhere
and it's way too short.
But as the years go by
and people tend to revisit
these types of things,
it's harder to focus on the negative
and much easier to focus on the positives.
Like for instance, the atmosphere,
which is beyond top-notch here.
The hub city of Prague is
still stunning, even now.
And the amount of little
secrets and side quests
hidden in this area rival the
best immersive sims out there.
(characters vocalizing)
The reality is that if
you're an immersive sim fan,
it's pretty slim pickings out there,
it's a genre that's never really caught on
no matter how many studios have tried
and in my opinion,
succeeded with the formula.
So you kind of just have
to take what you can get.
And that's the frustrating
thing about ""Mankind Divided"",
all the pieces are there to
make a truly legendary game,
but so much of it was
cut, we're left with,
I mean it's a good game,
a very good game, in fact.
Sometimes, games like that
are the best to come back to.
Also, you can come back to a
flawed game with fresh eyes
and understanding there will
be some disappointing stuff,
it's easy to just focus on the good stuff
and ""Mankind Divided"" has
a lot of good going on.
(dramatic music)
(battle sounds)
At number three is
""Divinity Original Sin 2"".
If you finish ""Baldur's Gate 3""
and you're looking for a
new CRPG to obsess over,
unhealthily, here,
""Divinity Original Sin 2"",
that's where to go.
It's not D&D and your party members
aren't quite as memorable as
the ones in ""Baldur's Gate 3"".
But the systematic world
is as intriguing to explore
as Larian's later game.
It's really fun to see
how many ideas they were
experimenting with here.
A lot of them got refined and
included in ""Baldur's Gate 3"",
which I mean, ""Original
Sin 2"" is a massive RPG.
It's got complex and
challenging turn-based combat.
- [Character] Abandon your
quest or destroy the world.
(intense music)
- [Falcon] A really dense world
filled with secrets and surprises.
It's basically the proto-""Baldur's Gate 3""
in every possible way.
And it shows, really,
why this was the right
developer to go with.
But it even has a controversial city area
that's the final act of the game.
I've played a lot of other RPGs,
but nobody quite makes
them the same as Larian.
They really let you embrace the chaos
and break their games wide open
in a way that few other devs allow.
And that's a big part of the
reason I love these games.
Maybe you bounced off
this one back in the day
but got into ""Baldur's Gate 3""
and now might be a good time to go back
and give this one another shot.
Now that you've got some experience
with how these devs do
things, it might click.
(dramatic music)
At number two is ""The Last Guardian"".
With no major official Sony games
coming in 2024, that we are aware of yet,
now's the time to go back
and give some appreciation
to the ones we lost along the way.
Sony was a publisher that used
to be on the cutting edge.
They would put out all kinds of weird,
wonderful things under their banner.
Not all these games worked,
but one of the most
consistently great studios
under their umbrella was Japan Studio.
These were the guys behind some
of the most memorable PlayStation
brands like ""Ape Escape"",
""Legend of Dragoon"", ""Everybody's
Golf"", ""Ico"", ""Siren"",
the list goes on.
If there is a Sony exclusive
that has some kind of cult following,
there's a good chance they
had something to do with it.
Just to be clear, they were
more of a division than a team.
They had multiple groups
working under one umbrella
and one was Team Ico,
who actually didn't survive long enough
to work on ""The Last Guardian"",
which yes, is getting confusing.
The history maybe isn't the
most important part here,
but ""The Last Guardian"" is quite good.
You should go back and play it.
That's what I'm trying to say here.
""Ico"" and ""The Shadow of Colossus"",
they're obvious classics,
but ""The Last Guardian's""
a little more contentious.
Some people love the
mystery, the creature,
and the more ponderous atmosphere
while others are trying to guide Trico
to nothing but frustration,
found it very miserable.
(creature roaring)
(character vocalizing)
That's, might I add,
what's gonna make or
break your enjoyment here.
If you're willing to
work with vague controls,
I feel like in 2024, people
are a little more accepting
of friction mechanics in games,
they're willing to accept design
that's actively working against you.
So in general, I think ""The Last Guardian""
might work a little better
now, especially on PS4 Pro
or PS5 with a more stable frame rate.
(character vocalizing)
(water splashing loudly)
The thing about this game
is you never really directly
control the creature,
all you can do is give it vague commands
that it may or may not follow.
This can be frustrating
in play to put it mildly,
especially at first
when you're still getting
the hang of things.
There is, for sure, a learning curve here,
but it does eventually get easier,
if you try to figure it out.
If you're not, I mean just
go play ""Shadow of Colossus"",
that game's awesome, too.
(creature screaming)
(epic music)
And finally at number
one is ""Alpha Protocol"",
the cult classic spy RPG
that got pulled from Steam back in 2019.
I, along with most people,
assumed that was the end.
So you can imagine our
collective surprise in 2024
when GOG started selling
the game on their storefront
and with all the licensed music intact.
They even throw in some improvements
that make the game play
nice with modern PCs.
That doesn't mean it's fixed or anything,
it's still a janky mess,
but that's part of the fun.
Everything negative said
about this game back in 2010,
still valid.
It is far from perfect,
but it's such a unique
and interesting experiment
that it's easy to overlook
all the bad stuff.
The controls are stiff,
the stealth is janky,
many powers are completely broken
and the game, well, it looked
dated back when it came out,
does not hold up today,
but it does deserve another shot,
partly because we don't see
a game like ""Alpha Protocol""
get de-listed and put back
up again at some point.
But also, it's a really interesting game.
People complain about games
not being reactive enough,
but this is a big exception to that.
The most impressive thing about this game
is how much can change from
one play through to the next.
And I'm not talking about the ending.
I mean, if certain characters live or die,
how certain missions will play out,
how characters talk to you
can all be super different
depending on your choices.
And that makes ""Alpha Protocol""
one of the most re-playable RPGs ever.
The only way to really
appreciate it is to play the game
through more than once to
really see the differences
and at least it's short.
It uses the mass effect
model of progression
where the story's split
into a series of missions
and that's a format I
wish more RPGs would use
because it keeps the story moving,
there's no tedious busy work
exploring a barren open world,
you just get straight to the good stuff.
In this game's case,
the good stuff is basically conversations,
but they're really well done,
even compared to certain games now.
The rest of the game
can be really divisive.
It's not necessarily for
everyone, but for people
willing to overlook the
game's weaker elements,
there's a lot of good to be had here.
I do have some bonuses for you.
""Spec Ops The Line"", for instance.
In 2024, as the years go by,
it's easier and easier
to respect what this game
was trying to do, even if
you actually like it or not.
Ignoring the satirical elements,
it is a competent shooter
with some amazing environments
and an excellent voice cast.
It deserves to be remembered
if only for doing
something very different.
Getting it is a little tough though,
it's de-listed from all major storefronts.
So you gotta either buy
a key off the gray market
or get a 360 copy, which is
pretty expensive, actually.
And then there's, finally,
""Watchdogs"" from 2014,
another Ubisoft open world
that it's getting a lot
more love online nowadays.
It wasn't exactly hated when it came out,
but it wasn't loved either.
I think this is partly
due to the expectations
that were set for this game,
which kind of weren't possible
to live up to at the time.
And this game has a lot going for it
that holds up really
well actually in 2024,
especially if you use some mods
people have made to keep the game alive.
There's a surprisingly large community
still working on this game
with updates and improvement.
Clearly the game struck a nerve
and keeps people coming back for more.
Pretty not bad for a game everyone
was calling forgettable back in 2014
'cause clearly people
have not forgotten it.
And that's all for today.

Wilson has time delivering a beatball
looking for auson who goes and gets it
oh Calvin auson with the Home
Run just a good style keep pounding it
if you can
Harris drops the ball it is loose still
down to the round I think Philadelphia
has it they
[Applause]
do third and five Herz gets rid of it
quickly as you said that should be a
first down it's Devonte Smith to move
the chains I know you like that one
better don't you I love that and that's
Rhythm that you can have as an offense
is catch the ball meanwhile Devonte
Smith game behind nine catches for 75
yds here's Barkley good cut for him and
surging forward near a first down going
to pick up about
[Applause]
nine Barkley again looking for a hole
makes one himself first down into
Steelers territory he goes and the mark
him down right at
Midfield he's not playing a style of
defense that pursues like these guys do
hers design on wide open up the middle
too Herz makes a man miss Herz taken
down inside the 30
[Applause]
hers looking out in the flat gets to the
game well makes a couple Miss still
going his gain well fighting towards the
end zone and he's taken down near the
one first and goal that's this you know
such a challenging play for a defense to
stop cuz they never even get an
opportunity to work on in practice do it
again Herz sh forward Jaylen Herz
is in touchdown Philadelphia
here's Russell Wilson now going to throw
they got a couple touchdowns to make up
and they get a completion to Austin have
such a good drive go down there and then
have nothing and the Eagles March down
the field and score a great TouchDown
for Daryl Patterson getting a couple
reps on this drive of running back and
that's going to be good enough for a
first down into e potential on the way
to be a 12 wi team that number one SE is
not locked up here's Wilson stepson
delivers good throw short of a first
down though and now with Mike Williams
bringing that one down check his
matchups and he knows he can always
scramble if he needs to looking to throw
it brown on the slant catches and runs
first down and more for AJ
Brown going to give it to Barkley That's
a good lead block first down absorbs a
big hit but up across the 43 pumps his
fist what can you do when they're
defending the Run use that pass game and
if they can continue to do that this is
a
very tough team to beat hers all day
looking over the middle Smith is wide
open makes the catch and he's inside the
40 they drop into coverage Herz gets rid
of it quickly Smith has a way to go head
down absorbs a hit and close but I think
a yard
short it'll be fourth down in one
brotherly
shove wow wow so try to get him to jump
Steelers were very Steelers we know can
clinch the division next week but it
won't happen today an impressive 2713
win for the Eagles and Nick serani here
at home as serani and Tomlin will meet",""

- [Falcon] Ah franchises.
Multiple video games in a single IP.
Sequels, we're often talking
about how bad they are,
how they're beating a dead horse,
but sometimes a franchise
deserves another entry.
Hi, folks, it's Falcon,
and today on Gameranx,
20 game franchises that
desperately need a comeback.
Starting off with number
20, it's ""BioShock.""
We have been hearing rumors
about a potential ""BioShock""
revival for many, many years.
It's the go-to prediction
for wanna-be leakers.
Is State of Play starting
or an Xbox Director of
Cozy Games Conference,
you bet someone is gonna
say the next ""BioShock""
is gonna be announced.
So far, it's just that,
rumors, grumblings,
the he said, she said bullshit.
Hell.
Sorry, my inner Fred Durst
came out for a moment.
Yeah, nothing.
It's a series that's way too big
not to bring back eventually, right?
There's just money left on the table.
But how and in what form
is always up in the air.
The original dev team
and the great leader,
Kevin Levine, left Take
Two to form a new studio,
which was then acquired by Take two
and now they're publishing their new game,
which is suspiciously ""BioShock"" like,
but has the numbers filed
off, which is weird.
The numbers are filed off despite the fact
that they have access to the IP.
It's what about whatever, whatever.
It's gonna inevitably lead to
a new ""BioShock"" game, right?
Hopefully, with Levine at the helm.
I could just write this whole thing off
and say that ""Judas""
is the new ""BioShock,""
but it looks pretty different.
You know, until Booker and Andrew Ryan
show up in the third act at some point.
Man, wouldn't that be awesome
if ""Judas"" was a stealth
sequel to ""BioShock""?
Ah, it's probably not.
Now, ""BioShock"" is a
controversial franchise.
""BioShock 2"" was regarded as not as good
and then got a reevaluation later.
Same goes for ""BioShock Infinite.""
But really, I just wanna
see that old timey aesthetic
combined with some sort of
political or ideological angle
that gets into unique flavor.
Just making an immersive sim
in an isolated location isn't enough.
Otherwise, ""Prey"" is a ""BioShock"" game.
What we want is a return to those vibes
that the best parts of the
original games gave us.
Doesn't need to be Rapture,
doesn't need to be Columbia.
Remember ""BioShock"" is
a insane multiverse,
which is why ""Judas""
could be a stealth sequel,
I don't know.
I will say ""BioShock Infinite""
got a little lost in the meta narrative
and lacked some of the
environmental storytelling
that made the original
""BioShock"" as engaging as it was.
But the combat, to be
fair, is quite a bit better
and the Skylines are fun
as hell to ride around on,
especially in battle.
You could say these types of
games have been done to death.
Wandering around spooky corridors
and listening to audio logs.
You could say it's played out,
but, you know, it's not exactly a problem
or the genre's fault it got
bad because it got popular.
Everybody and their mother tried
to make one of these things
at some point.
And I think the fact that a
lot of them aren't as good
as the big ones,
""BioShock"" probably being in the top three
along with the games that inspired it,
""System Shock 2"" and ""Thief.""
But just like with those games,
the tough thing is making something new
and to some extent, something
that maybe works better.
Like as great as these games were,
a lot of that was the content
rather than the mechanics.
Sometimes the mechanics
were a little wonky
in all of these types of games,
but you gotta capture what
made the original game so great
and that's probably why
it's taken them so long
to make something with ""BioShock.""
And number 19 is ""Splinter Cell.""
Losing Michael Ironside, the
iconic voice of Sam Fisher,
was kind of the death
blow to the franchise,
never recovered after 2013's blacklist,
which completed the main
character's transformation
from grouchy and sardonic super spy
to generic military man number 136.
Seriously, you hear this guy's voice,
he'd be indistinguishable
as a background grunt in
any ""Call of Duty"" campaign.
- [Sam] I'm entering the plaza
Militia's blocking the front door access.
- [NPC] Sam, you need to change position.
Meet you on the ground.
- [Sam] Get eyes from the
southwest corner of the plaza.
- [NPC] Copy, moving now
- [Sam] Grim, keep trying
to reach our contact.
Let me know if you get
through the meeting.
- Copy.
- The voice change
was utterly devastating.
Cannot be understated just
how bad that new voice was.
So the series has a tough uphill battle
if it's ever coming back.
There have been rumors of
a possible reboot or remake
of the first game that have
been floating around for years,
but so far, nothing has come of it.
Ubisoft is just terrible
at remaking their games.
Remember ""Prince of Persia:
The Sands of Time"" remake?
It was supposed to come
out in like 2020, 2021,
and now they're saying 2026.
Guys, that game wasn't complicated.
What is going on over there?
So the chances of this series coming back
anytime soon are unlikely,
but come on, it's gotta
come back eventually, right?
Once upon a time, stealth
was ""Metal Gear Solid""
and ""Splinter Cell.""
That was the two premier stealth series.
Serious prestige there.
The first three games sold gangbusters.
They innovated the stealth
genre in a lot of important ways
and they were a staple
of the gaming ecosystem
for a pretty good stretch.
But once the initial trilogy was done,
Ubisoft really couldn't quite figure out
what they wanted the series to be.
If it were up to me to revive the series,
I'd go back to the semi-realistic roots,
set the story in a
somewhat plausible reality,
focus on what makes the series great
with hardcore in-depth stealth systems,
and focus on the best
parts of the original game.
And you know, taking some inspiration
for more recent stealth games
that really knocked it out of the park
like the ""World of
Assassination,"" ""Hitman"" trilogy,
and make some massive nonlinear levels
with lots of sub-objectives
that can affect the course of the mission.
There's so much you could do here.
and with ""Metal Gear solid""
MIA for the time being,
there's definitely room for
a new king of stealth games.
And ""Splinter Cell"" could easily be it,
just don't make it another
generic open world game.
That's the only real like Pratt Fall
or obstacle I could foresee.
Just bring it back guys.
And number 18 is ""Legacy of Kain""
for how popular they were and still are.
It's crazy there has
not been a real attempt
at reviving this franchise.
Yeah, we got that oddball
""Nosgoth"" multiplayer game
that nobody wanted,
but a real follow-up has
just never materialized.
There isn't even like a bare
minimum, like a new compilation
or a remaster of soul reaver.
There's just, there's nothing.
There was supposed to be a
sixth century in the franchise
that was gonna follow
the story post defiance,
but it got canceled.
Fans found footage from
another ""Kain"" sequel
called ""Dead Sun,"" but still just nothing.
There's nothing.
It's a shame 'cause
there was never anything
quite like the ""Legacy of Kain"" games.
Like even when the last few entries of it
weren't like stellar, they
still had an amazing atmosphere
and top-notch voice acting.
(dramatic music)
- [Kain] And so I return to
the sanctuary of my enemy,
the fortress of the Sarafan Brotherhood,
deemed impossible for
any man to penetrate.
Impossible for any man.
- [Falcon] It'll be
tough to make a new game
without the dulcet tones of Tony Jay,
but he wasn't a main character
so they could make it work.
The hard part I think
is finding somebody to
actually develop it.
The studio most associated with
the series Crystal Dynamics
is pretty much the ""Tomb Raider"" team.
We know that the Embracer
Group acquired the IP
along with several other
Square Enix owned Western IPs,
but it's unlikely they're making a new
""Kain"" game anytime soon.
You know, because of
everything involving Embracer.
Seriously, disastrous couple
years for that company.
If they're canceling ""Deus
Ex"" games mid production,
""Legacy of Kain"" doesn't
stay in a chance, right?
It's a real shame 'cause
it's not hard to imagine
what a modern version of
this series would look like.
It'd feel right at home
with all the other dark
fantasy action series
that are actually pretty popular now.
It'd just have a more
cinematic style to it
and yeah, that'd be fun.
I'd like that.
The return of such a venerable franchise,
assuming the game was good,
would be an easy slam dunk.
From my perspective, it
seems like a safe bet.
The problem is that it was
in the hands of Square Enix
who we're gonna do nothing with it.
And then Embracer who is Embracer.
They're probably gonna do
nothing with it for now.
I think for a while, they're
probably gonna be working
on patching the hole in their boat.
Those guys are treading
some water, let me tell you.
I'm still kicking them when
they're down, you know?
But yeah, it's a franchise
that's stuck in limbo
owned by publishers who either refuse
or can't make a new game,
but they also don't wanna
sell it to someone else
because you know, at some point, right?
And number 17 is ""Dishonored.""
Yeah, ""Redfall"" was a flop
and Arkane is in kind of
a tough spot right now
with the closing of their
Austin, Texas Space studio.
But now's the perfect opportunity
to salvage their reputation
by going back to what they do best
and making a new ""Dishonored"" game.
They kind of sort of wrapped
up the story of the games
with death of the outsider,
but there's a lot they could do with it.
The setting's so unique that
it feels like a big waste
ending the series after two games,
especially after they showed
the kind of innovative stuff they can do
with the setting with levels
like the Clockwork Mansion
and the time travel tricks
and behind the Slab.
I mean that was limited
by like PS4 hardware.
Imagine the kind of crazy stuff
that could come with now for a third game.
The possibilities are just endless
and that's what made these games so fun.
Each level felt like a sandbox
where you could explore everything
as thoroughly as you wanted.
Finish a mission in five
minutes or five hours,
it's up to you.
There was an unprecedented
amount of player freedom
in these games.
It just made them such a joy to play.
You could play them straight,
you could go completely nuts
with all these powers at your disposal.
The stealth was fun, the powers were fun.
Running and sliding, that
was fun in and of itself.
I don't know what it was
about ""Dishonored"" sliding.
It was just so freaking fun to do.
I know other games have it,
but it just felt better there.
Arkane has said the series is on hold
and they're currently
working on a ""Blade"" game,
which with another developer,
I'd probably be pretty hyped with.
But I don't want an
immersive sim with ""Blade""
and I certainly don't want them
not making an immersive sim
to make generic ""Blade"" souls-like TM.
Like they know how to make immersive sims.
That's what they should be doing.
Give ""Blade"" to Platinum
Games or some shit.
That'd be a hell of a game.
I'm guessing it's probably
just gonna be a safe, stupid
IP-based game.
Microsoft probably isn't gonna
let them throw any Hail Marys
with the the closing of half of them,
the payloads, you know?
Like obviously, I hope ""Blade"" is good
and I hope it's successful
'cause I want the studio to stick around
for a very long time and
I think that whole idea
probably has something to do with that.
If they throw down and give us something
completely unimaginable, great.
But I'll tell you what's a
really safe bet for a studio.
The thing that made them famous.
And number 16 is ""Dino Crisis.""
With all the revivals
Capcom's been making recently,
there's one series that's
still conspicuously absent,
""Dino Crisis.""
It's ""Resident Evil"" with dinosaurs.
There is nothing else to say.
There's only two things anyone
knows about these games.
There's Regina, the main
character who's iconic,
she's essential.
Bringing her back is non-negotiable.
And then there's dinosaurs.
Like you just need to have
those things and it's that game.
Maybe don't set it in space.
That's what they did in ""Dino Crisis 3.""
That didn't work out too well
and arguably killed the series.
But hey, it's not too hard
to make a good dinosaur shooter, right?
It's been a long freaking time too.
""Dino Crisis 3"" was in 2003.
It's been more than 20 years
since there's been a new
entry in this series.
That's a long time to
wait for a follow up.
And they brought back ""Dragon's
Dogma"" for Christ's sake.
Not that that wasn't a big success.
It absolutely was, but
that wasn't a guarantee.
The original was, you
know, not a big success.
Not until late in the game
with a lot of word of mouth
and Steam sales at least.
And no, ""Exoprimal"" doesn't count.
It's completely unrelated
to the ""Dino Crisis"" series.
Yeah, it surprised me too.
And number, 15 ""Red Faction.""
This one is another one
very close to my heart.
Probably nearly as close if
not as close as ""Dishonored.""
Sadly, with the death of Volition,
the hope that there would ever
be a new ""Red Faction"" game
is pretty much dead.
If we're being honest,
the writing was on the
wall for a long time.
Didn't seem like ""Saints Row"" was capable
of making another ""Red
Faction: Guerrilla.""
Like they couldn't even
make a game like it
that was a direct follow up.
It seems like they probably
weren't gonna do something
as complex programming and physics wise
after ""Agents of Mayhem""
and the ""Saints Row"" reboot.
It's sad, but it's the truth.
""Red Faction"" was a series long dead
before volition even closed its doors.
And you could argue that might be part
of why Volition closed its doors.
But then again, a ""Red Faction"" reboot
like the ""Saints Row"" reboot
wouldn't have exactly
made me happy either.
That doesn't mean we don't want someone,
anyone to make a new one.
I mean I guess they could
go back to the series' roots
and make a first person game
with some modular destruction elements.
The follow up to ""Guerrilla""
kind of was that a little.
But you know what everyone wants
and it's not wandering around a mine
blowing up tiny chunks of wall.
We want a new ""Red Faction: Guerrilla.""
That's what the world wants,
but the gaming industry steadfastly
refuses to give us that.
Yeah, there's been some
fun little indie games
that show off unimpressive
amount of destruction.
""Teardown"" comes to mind.
It's probably the most
fully formed of them,
but the rest of them are
more or less tech demos.
You can argue that ""THE
FINALS"" incorporates
probably the most extensive
version of that nowadays.
But it's also not ""Red
Faction: Guerrilla.""
Does that make me mad at ""THE FINALS""?
Absolutely not.
""THE FINALS"" is precious to me,
but it is also not ""Red
Faction: Guerrilla,""
it's a multiplayer shooter.
We're talking about ""Red
Faction: Guerrilla.""
The thing I want here is
""Red Faction: Guerrilla.""
Like, okay, so if you've
ever played ""THE FINALS,""
you do basically know what a
modern game could look like
with ""Red Faction: Guerrilla's""
procedural destruction.
They handled it in fact actually better
than ""Red Faction: Guerrilla.""
So imagine that
in a ""Red Faction:
Guerrilla"" reboot or sequel.
Best frigging thing ever.
But so far, nobody's
willing to attempt it,
at least not on the
level that the game did.
It wasn't just test chambers
or short little missions.
It was an entire open world
with so many things to smash.
Yes, the world was mostly
barren with a lot of canyons
that conveniently separated each area
so the game could run on an Xbox,
but those were necessary compromises
that the setting itself, Mars,
actually in my opinion, kind of justified.
So many of those problems
will be solved now.
But with the gaming community
so focused on fidelity,
I think developers are
afraid to make games
that don't look perfect,
but still incorporate
some amazing technology,
at least when you're talking
about the ones that are capable
of looking a lot better.
With a lot of indie studios, to be fair,
pixel art's about as good as they could do
with the idea and the
budget that they might have.
And that is in no way their fault.
They're the little guys
and they put out incredible stuff too.
It's just somebody publishing
a ""Red Faction"" game
can do a lot more.
And as far as I know,
they're just not willing to put the money
into something as experimental as this.
Even though the original
game's extremely popular
among the people who actually played it.
I wouldn't hold my breath
for this series coming back.
This is another one that got embraced
because Embracer back in
2018 bought Koch Media
who was not called Koch Media anymore.
They have a name that
I'm not sure how to say
and I don't care enough.
Embracer's who owns ""Red Faction.""
That's really, that's what matters.
And number 14 is ""Deus Ex.""
Like I said early in the
""Legacy of Kain"" entry,
the rights to ""Deus Ex""
were purchased by Embracer.
Funny how there are reasons
so many games don't get made.
You know, being a games publisher,
they were gonna make a new ""Deus
Ex,"" but that got canceled.
Hope was formed and then
dashed in a single sentence.
No matter what the flavor
of ""Deus Ex"" you're into,
be it original year 2000
game or the prequels,
""Human Revolution"" and ""Mankind Divided.""
Or if you're nasty and begotten,
the sequel, ""Invisible War.""
Regardless, you want a new game.
It's one of the seminal works
of cyberpunk and video games
with some really impressive world building
and crazy immersive environments.
Personally, I'd like a
new game more in the tone
of the original game with
its conspiratorial themes
and unusual philosophical diversions.
Maybe with a little bit
more of the gameplay
of the Adam Jensen game.
Even so, I would take a
brand new Adam Jensen game
with no major tonal shifts
back to the more original tone.
But the voice actor for Adam Jensen
is all but confirmed the
prequel game are dead,
which sucks 'cause they never
got to finish their story.
I mean the conclusion
was going to be the original ""Deus Ex,""
but a lot of plot threads
of ""Mankind Divided""
were never resolved
and Jensen's true nature was
also never truly revealed.
Lots of unanswered questions
and whole lot of potential
just left fallow.
And now that everybody
loves ""Cyberpunk 2077""
despite its initial disastrous launch,
it's gonna be a tough act to follow.
If they made a new ""Deus Ex,"" now,
it's gonna get compared to that game,
which is a full open world RPG.
""Deus Ex"" doesn't need to be that huge.
It needs to be a dense world
with an interesting story.
But the way games are made now,
a lot of publishers don't
think that's enough.
It is, but they don't think it is.
And number 13, ""Onimusha,"" another entry,
another Capcom franchise
trapped in the past.
""Onimusha"" should be an easy sell.
It's ""Devil May Cry""
before ""Devil May Cry.""
It's the first real offshoot
of the ""Resident Evil"" series
that went full on action
rather than horror.
Those original games on the
PlayStation 2 were great.
For some reason, Capcom
only ported the first one
to Modern Hardware, but all
four of them are really good.
""Onimusha 3"" especially,
I would put up there
with some of the all
time great action games.
It's fantastic and has a
completely nutso premise.
Yeah, that's the one with Jean Reno
Time travel is involved, it is fantastic.
Batshit nuts in the best way.
Games set in Japan are
just as popular as ever.
Just this year, we've
gotten several of them.
Hell, Capcom put out ""Kunitsu-Gami,""
which is by the way, fantastic.
I've been singing ""Kunitsu-Gami's"" praises
since it came out.
Not enough people played it.
If you like Pickman, tower
defense, and action games,
it's those three things at
once and it does it well.
Seriously, try it.
It's such a good game.
Nobody's saying no to more Samurai though.
And for whatever reason, Capcom
refuses to give ""Onimusha""
the series the respect it deserves.
Maybe there's rights issues.
The games did use celebrity likenesses
for a lot of its characters,
but I don't know, I kind of doubt that.
Also, I don't really care,
I just want more ""Onimusha.""
Revive the franchise,
give it that ""Devil May
Cry 5"" coat of paint
and it'll sell gangbusters.
I promise you.
I know Capcom is interested
in reviving long dormant franchises,
so anything's on the table.
So like it's just a
matter of them doing it.
So Capcom, do it.
And number 12 is ""Mega Man
X"" or ""Mega Man Legends""
or ""Mega Man Battle Network.""
They brought back the original ""Mega Man""
with ""Mega Man 11,""
but after that game proved
successful, they stopped.
Yeah, they've been putting out collections
for a while now and it's cool.
We can all play the ""Mega Man X"" games
pretty easily nowadays.
And they've got the ""Zero""
and ""Battle Network"" games
all in one convenient package there.
But those are all old games.
I want something new.
Like you'd think we would've gotten
a new ""X"" game at this point, right?
That seems like the most
obvious thing to do after 11,
but it hasn't happened.
For many folks growing up,
this is the definitive series.
I played ""Mega Man"" on
the NES from the start
and ""X"" is, in my opinion,
the definitive series.
Part of the problem I think
is that Capcom kind of
oversaturated the market
and the last three games in the series
are all different levels
of absolutely terrible.
They really didn't realize
that you just have to make
""Mega Man X"" as ""Mega Man X.""
You come up with new levels.
You don't reinvent the wheel.
The innovation is in the levels
and adding new powers and stuff like that.
It's not, I mean, I don't
want a 3D ""Mega Man X""
It doesn't work.
Is it terrible?
No, but relative to any
good ""Mega Man X"" game,
yes, it is terrible.
Also, let's talk ""Mega
Man Legends,"" right?
It was gonna be a sequel,
but it got canceled
and the series has just been
nostalgia bait ever since,
how they could at least make
a new battle networking.
Those were crazy popular games.
They have one of the most
interesting battle systems
in any RPG.
Seeing a modern version
with new bells and whistles
would be fricking awesome.
Like think about ""Mega Man Battle Network""
looking like ""Persona.""
Now, Capcom's got the money,
just partner with Atlas and do it.
I don't think Sega would be too upset
to take some cash there.
Like there's so many dead
""Mega Man"" franchises.
Really, if you wanna split hairs,
""Mega Man,"" like where's 12?
11 was a fully realized badass sequel.
It was hard as hell,
but I mean not the hardest
in the ""Mega Man"" series.
It doesn't need to be the hardest.
They gave us some pretty
good levels in 2018.
And number 11 is ""TimeSplitters""
the true spiritual sequel
to ""GoldenEye 007.""
It's not ""Perfect Dark,"" well, it is,
but they made ""Perfect
Dark Zero,"" which sucked
and ""TimeSplitters"" got
two great follow up.
So I ask you, which is the franchise
that truly deserves a follow up?
Both in a perfect world,
but in an imperfect world
where you can only pick one,
it's gotta be ""TimeSplitters"" all right?
There's really nothing
quite like these games.
They've got the perfect
amount of multiplayer chaos.
They're single player campaigns,
they're fun and quirky.
They're just great games
that managed to be the
best spiritual successor
while having a unique identity of its own.
What really kills me about this one
is there was gonna be ""TimeSplitters 4.""
It was happening and it got Embraced.
Like if it's any indicator,
Embracer has a lot to answer for.
It seems like every
other game on this list,
it was gonna give a comeback
and then Embracer embraced
everything about it.
Though hope is still
alive for ""TimeSplitters.""
So anything's possible
when you're writing pie
in the sky YouTube lists.
These kinds of lists aren't
necessarily wish fulfillment.
It's more wish having.
If you put it out there,
it's better than not
putting it out there, right?
That's what I'm doing here.
""TimeSplitters"" is a series
that by all accounts, should return.
It exists in its own little niche.
There really aren't other games like it
doing exactly what it does.
The variety of weapons, the goofy modes,
the ""Goldeneye"" style
aiming, the varied campaigns,
oh, and the cartoonish art style.
It's really just a unique series.
There is no other and it
deserves a proper comeback.
And number 10 is ""Banjo-Kazooi.""
File this one under duh.
Everyone wants a new ""Banjo.""
People put millions of
dollars kick-starting
what is essentially a clone game.
And to be frank,
""Banjo-Kazooi"" had moved beyond
that paradigm and moved into being
""Legend of Zelda: Tears of
the Kingdom's"" building stuff
long before that even existed.
And it wouldn't bother me
to see some of that stuff
return in a true ""Banjo"" sequel.
But here's the thing.
Where's ""Banjo""?
Bring back ""Banjo.""
Everyone wants ""Banjo.""
People went batshit crazy
when it got announced first for Smash,
but Rare nowadays is not the same company
that made the various SNES
and Nintendo 64 classics
""Banjo-Kazooi"" being one.
Not to say their recent output is bad,
there's just none of it or
at least not much of it.
It's not bad though,
just not what the fans
of their old games want.
They were the guys who did
connectathons probably the best,
the big cartoonist levels we run around,
picking up tons of crap for some reason
while Giant Kirk hopes bouncy score plays.
We want power ups and mini games
and all that stuff that
these games are known for.
What a lot of people don't want
is the custom vehicles aspect.
I like the custom vehicles aspect.
I think that it could exist
inside the traditional
""Banjo-Kazooi"" paradigm,
not be the primary focus of it
and be quite enjoyable honestly.
(playful music)
But ""Nuts and Bolts"" is not
the game that most fans wanted.
In hindsight, I think
it's an interesting game.
Very creative.
Again, like I said,
did ""Tears of the Kingdom""
before ""Tears of the Kingdom.""
If ""Nuts and Bolts"" was just a spinoff
and a third proper game had come out,
I don't think anybody
would be sour about it.
But the third game never happened.
At this point, like just give
the license to the clone guys,
the ""Yooka-Laylee"" guys.
I mean all the founders of Platonic,
the creators of ""Yooka-Laylee""
came from the original Rare
that Rare isn't anymore.
So they have a pretty good grasp
on how that kind of game works.
The original ""Yooka-Laylee""
was a little rough,
but the side scrolling sequel
is actually a lot better.
If Rare is not gonna have
anything to do with ""Banjo"" though,
they might as well like let somebody else
do it the right way.
It doesn't need to be like earth shaking.
It just needs to be ""Banjo-Kazooi.""
And number nine is ""Burnout.""
It seems like every major race and game
focuses on semi realism,
you know, cartooning
and following race lines
and driving carefully and precisely.
That's what ""Need for speed"" and ""Forts""
and ""Test Drive Unlimited""
all wanna do these days.
The lack of a game like
""Burnout"" is conspicuous.
Where are the insane speeds,
the boosts, the gnarly crashes?
Most racers basically don't
have car deformation anymore.
What is that?
And I'm not saying that's exclusive
to more arcadey or insane
stuff like ""Burnout.""
There is pretty good car deformation
in a few various racing
games like ""BeamNG.drive""
but you just, you don't get
the same absolute decimation
that could be inflicted on a vehicle
in a game like ""Burnout.""
Imagine a modern AAA ""Burnout""
with physics like ""BeamNG.drive""
That'd be insane.
(tires screeching)
(cars crashing)
Soft body physics ""Burnout"" would be,
that'd be a perfect game.
These games are all about aggression.
You crash opponents,
crash into traffic and the environment.
You just keep going.
Crashing isn't a fail state.
Half the time, it is the goal
and it's got the after touchability
where you can steer
your car after crashing,
which allows for some vengeance
even when you're careening out of control.
These games are freaking awesome.
Either the originals or the
open world ""Burnout"" paradise.
I'm fine with a follow
up in either direction.
The only big thing I
absolutely cannot do without
is crash mode.
It's one of the greatest
game modes in history.
They somehow turn a four-way pile
up into a satisfying puzzle.
The saddest thing about
this series is the studio
that made them is still around.
Criterion's still with EA,
but they're stuck as a support
studio, forever toiling away
in the ""Need for Speed""
and ""Battlefield of Minds.""
Instead of a mind blowing
new ""Burnout"" game,
they're stuck making crappy
modes for ""Battlefield 2042""
that nobody's gonna play anyway.
Truly, a fate worse than death.
And number eight is true crime,
but really, ""Sleeping Dogs.""
Let's be real here.
Everyone wants a new ""Sleeping Dogs.""
That game was great.
A real viable alternative
to ""Grand Theft Auto""
and that's not an easy thing to do.
It did its own thing, it was different.
It was more Arcadia, a
little more action-packed
without being a total
cartoon like ""Saints Row.""
It struck just the right
balance between serious
and silly in a way that
""Grand Theft Auto"" doesn't.
In a just world,
the developer would've
gone on to great success.
There would've been multiple sequels.
It could have been absolutely amazing.
Instead we got two kind of
weird mediocre true crime games.
One great true crime game
and then they had to change the name
because it was acquired by Square Enix
and one failed MMO follow-up
that nobody wanted.
The fact ""Sleeping Dogs""
managed to come out at all
is a minor miracle.
It was even more impressive
that it was actually good though.
It should have been simple.
Just make a sequel.
That was like the first one, but better.
But eh, it's not that simple.
If you look at the development history,
you'll see just how bizarre
of a production history
United Front Games has.
They made ""ModNation Racers,""
a ""LittleBigPlanet Karting"" game,
the definitive edition of Tomb ""Raider,""
just the definitive edition, nothing else.
Sandwich between that
is a highly polished,
big budget open world action gap.
(dramatic music)
(NPC chattering)
(NPCs grunting)
(NPCs chattering)
(tires screeching)
(NPCs chattering)
Like maybe they were just
incapable of making a follow-up.
I just don't know what happened.
There were plans to
make ""Sleeping Dogs 2,""
but it never got off the ground.
It wouldn't be absolutely awesome
if some other talented
studio could come in
and continue where they left off
or if they would do it either way.
But the likelihood of either
happening is pretty low.
Might as well be zero
honestly from the looks.
Still, even though it probably
will never happen, it should.
And number seven is ""Spyro the Dragon.""
That guy, he's heavily rumored to fly.
Again, thanks to the newly
independent games for Bob,
but at the time of this writing,
we have no idea what
their mystery game is.
Could be a new IP, could
be a ""Spyro"" sequel.
We all want it to be.
Will it be? I don't know.
Once Insomniac was done with
the series after three games,
various publishers
conspired to drive the
series into the ground.
First we got Vivendi's embarrassingly bad
""Enter the Dragonfly,"" then
Bizarre Eurocom reboot games
where Spyro is voiced by
Frodo himself, Elijah Wood,
but Gary, Gary Oldman was in these things.
David Spade as Sparx.
That can't be real.
It is though.
Those first three PlayStation
games were great though.
I mean this is Insomniac
we're talking about.
Those guys have been consistently good
for the past 20 plus years.
Toys for Bob, no slouch either.
I mean they did those ""Skylanders"" games,
but they've been around forever
and their work on the ""Spyro"" remaster
was absolutely stellar.
After the ""Crash"" collection,
they made ""Crash 4.""
So everyone expected
they'd be doing a proper
""Spyro 4"" eventually as well.
And then they left Activision.
So it seemed like the dream was dead.
Then they turned around
and immediately made
a deal with Microsoft.
So it's possible they're
doing an actual ""Spyro"" game
and I hope they are.
(dramatic music)
(balloons popping)
They made a lot of small,
but smart improvements to the remasters.
And ""Crash 4"" was absolutely excellent,
barring the sometimes
overturned difficulty.
""Spyro"" was never about
precision platforming though.
It's more just about being a fun game
with a unique move set.
No other game makes it as fun
to charge around everywhere
as ""Spyro"" does.
Nobody does it like ""Spyro,"" period.
It's a simple series,
but the originals really still hold up.
A proper modern sequel
feels like a no brainer.
And number six is ""Crimson Skies.""
If all you had was an Xbox,
you might not even be aware
that ""Crimson Skies"" was a franchise.
It actually started out on PC.
The original game was super different
from the more Arcadia Xbox follow up,
but it's mostly still
a real aviation game,
just with slightly more forgiving physics.
The PC Original is a real classic,
but the Xbox version's great too.
They're very different games.
The Xbox game, you kind of
fly an Arwing from ""Star Fox.""
Any semblance of simulation
is kind of thrown out the window.
But the alternate universe,
1930 setting is awesome.
The music was absolutely great.
The mission design's topnotch.
It's a series that really
should have seen more success.
- [Pilot] My cover's blown.
Repeat, my cover's blown.
I need backup.
- [NPC] Attention, this
settlement is operating
in violation of David
Dunbar's Anti-Piracy Act.
- [Pilot] It got me.
(plane exploding)
(guns firing)
- [Falcon] I think a
modern ""Crimson Skies""
would really work.
They could innovate by borrowing
from something like ""Dark Void""
where you occasionally
get out of your plane
and do a shootout on foot.
Not something I do all the time.
Again, to bring up ""Star Fox,""
all the on foot crap did not work
in that one ""Star Fox"" game.
But I mean it would mix things up a little
and if you do it right, it's good.
But I mean would they do it right?
That lame ""Front Mission"" reboot game
also did something like that.
Wasn't great.
So maybe I'm asking for ""The Monkey's Paw""
to curl with this one,
but however, this hypothetical
unnamed mystery developer
decides to modernize the series.
I'd be there for it.
And number five, an actual
new ""Castlevania"" game
with all the remasters and remakes
and DLCs that Konami is
putting out for this series.
Seriously, I mean, look
back over the last decade.
It's easy to forget
that there hasn't been a new
""Castlevania"" since 2014.
Wait, I lie.
There's actually the
""Haunted Castle"" remake
that came packed in with
the Dominus collection.
That's pretty much built
from the ground up,
but at the end of the
day, it's still a remake.
It is the closest thing
to something new we've seen in the series
for about 10 years.
So any chance there is for
hope, fans are gonna take it.
(dramatic music)
There's so many directions.
They could go with a new game,
they could make a new classic game.
They could go the Metroidvania route,
like they could make a
""Lords of Shadow"" sequel.
I'd be fine with that.
It'll have to be better
than ""Lords of Shadow 2.""
You couldn't make something
worse if you tried.
But still, if you're dying
of thirst in the desert,
you don't complain about
what's in the canteen
someone hands you.
As long as it ain't poison,
you drink it and you like it.
Unless it's another
""Castlevania"" pachinko machine,
then get the hell out of here with that.
Moving on to number four,
it's ""Ninja Gaiden.""
Another series that's been
away from the spotlight
for quite a while.
The anti-alias games are
classic in ""Ninja Gaiden Black""
on the original Xboxes,
one of the best action games of all time.
But after they flopped hard
with one of the biggest unforced
errors in gaming history,
with ""Ninja Gaiden 3,""
Team Ninja's pretty much
moved on to other things.
They still do good work
and all the recent games
are pretty damn solid.
But I can't help but
wonder what this modern
revitalized version of Team Ninja could do
if they return to their roots.
It doesn't have to be ""Ninja
Gaiden Black"" all over again.
If they wanted, they could even make
a new souls-like style game.
Just gotta have a jump button.
Strong movement abilities are
a major part of the identity
of ""Ninja Gaiden,"" along
with pretty high difficulty.
So obviously, it couldn't be
a straightforward souls-like,
but maybe they could bring back
a somewhat more grounded reality
like the original NES game
where a few places almost
looked like the real world
and there were CI agents skulking around
as opposed to the total
fantasy world of the Xbox game.
But this is another case
where it doesn't really matter
what they do, it'd just be
nice if they did something new.
(weapons clashing)
(fighters grunting)
And number three is ""Def Jam.""
These games were nuts.
It's not really a surprise
they didn't last long
'cause they were totally
relying on licensing everything.
Had to license appearances,
music, absolutely everything.
It would've been a fun game
without rappers playing themselves,
but that's really what pushes the game
over the edge from an interesting curio
to an all time great.
It was just so much frigging fun.
It was developed by AKI or AKI,
I don't really say the name
of that developer often.
The wrestling game guys.
And it plays like a streamlined
version of those games.
It works though 'cause honestly,
it's a lot better than
most wrestling games
back then and even now.
They just hit the perfect temp
where fights are flashy and fun,
but they don't drag on too long
and they're really accessible.
It's easy to jump in, jump
out, play with friends,
and that's the best way
to play these games.
Period.
The first two games are all time classics
and have a pretty good cross section
of major acts from the early 2003s.
Imagine if they made
one of these things now.
It'd be totally crazy,
but also very unlikely.
I loved these things as a kid.
The music, the presentation,
the real world rappers,
it's just so much frigging fun.
It feels like something
you could only pull off
in the 2000s.
I can't see the biggest
rappers lending their voices
and appearances to something
like this now other than Ice-T.
He would probably do it.
And number two is ""Siren.""
The first two ""Siren"" games
developed by Japan Studio
and published by Sony were
straight up terrifying.
They're some of the most
unsettling horror games ever made.
But outside of an ill
conceived attempt at a reboot
with ""Siren Blood Curse,""
the series has been dead
for almost two decades.
They didn't catch on
back in the early 2000s,
but I think now they would
have a much better chance
of catching an audience.
They're grungy, a little
awkward to control.
They have impenetrable stories
that can only be fully understood
after multiple playthroughs.
That sort of thing wasn't
generally understood
as a positive back then, but now,
oh, we love our obscure games, don't we?
(ominous music)
- [NPC] Did you see anything else?
(NPC panting)
- [NPC] They are no longer.
(NPCs chattering)
(monster growling)
- [Falcon] The most
impossibly opaque, the better.
There's real potential for a revival too.
People love horror games now,
especially spiritual
successors to ""Silent Hill.""
Wowee.
The main problem for any
revival is Sony themselves.
They've all but shuttered
their Japan studio
and don't seem that interested
in publishing another game
as strange and unsettling as this one.
Its appeal is too limited for Sony
looking for the next big live service hit
as if that's gonna happen.
They don't want moody horror games.
They want ""Concord,""
which flopped horribly
and cost like $200 million.
Maybe they should go back to
the single player horror games
or just single player games in general.
It seems like Sony is going
through one of those phases
where they forgot why people like them.
And finally, at number one,
be still my beating heart,
""Chrono Trigger.""
""Chrono Cross"" makes this
a bonafide franchise,
but let's not fool anyone here.
As much as ""Chrono Cross""
has its own fan following
and it does do stuff that
expands the lore in weird ways,
I like it, but we really
want a new ""Chrono Trigger.""
A proper follow up
that is the same fast-paced and fun story,
the time hopping shenanigans,
and that fantastic iconic score.
""Chrono Cross"" did at
least have that last one.
The music for ""Chrono
Cross"" is unparalleled,
but for the most part, it's
a completely different beast.
The original ""Chrono Trigger""
is just a big standout
from almost any RPG of that time.
Help, it's different from
most of them even now.
It's stood the test of time, right?
Appropriate given the theme.
It's fast paced, it's
got this zippy momentum.
You're never doing the
same thing too many times.
They're constantly introducing new things,
new little gimmicks, new dungeons,
new party members, new time periods.
This game is just on
the go the whole time.
It's also one of the shortest
of these SquareSoft RPG classics.
But there is not a hint
of fat on this thing.
It is all killer, no filler.
And most RPGs are like 90% filler.
That's what people want.
Sure, we all love the hundred-hour
behemoth every once in a while,
but games don't need to be
massively bloated to be good.
In fact, bloated is bad.
It doesn't mean the game is
bad, but the bloat sure is.
""Chrono Trigger,""
perfect example of something
without any, oh, that bloat.
And that's all for today.

because of how poor they are it is back
to- back runs to start this game en Rico
D with a big hole and a nice run to the
40 so today's a chance to show everybody
how far we've come the last few weeks
back to lamb everything that's gone
wrong for the Cowboys this season and JC
horn to the top of the screen on third
and four Blitz coming rush in trouble
and Rush is sacked it was horn who came
and the Blitz and that's what Carolina's
done more and more the last few games
Greg a benefit for this Young
quarterback second and five young looks
to throw for the first time he's given
all day finds hubard out of the back
field and chuba hub's got seven and a
panther first down facing a third down
right here Dallas been really aggressive
on third Downs they only Rush four that
is a reception for jayen Coker undrafted
rookie in his first game back from the
quad injury gets 15 yds and a nice throw
from Young CD lamb is probably the only
one that's not on that list third and
short it's HT out of the back field to
convert second reception for
hubber that close to anding Phil's first
loss in months here's H again out of the
back field his third catch and a first
down for the
Panthers couple nice conversions here on
this drive only Kiren Williams gets a
larger percentage of his team's carries
than chuba hubard does he's got it again
here a seam off the right side Hub with
the stiff arm into the clear first down
gain of 11 for chba hubber and then the
yards after contact that's a comp that's
all indicative of the runner here's
Young on the Move Young eyes down field
makes Parson's Miss with the spin move
and Dives ahead lost the ball Dallas is
on it it's a turnover and the Cowboys
take over Marsh nean recovers third down
and long Rush throws underneath cidi
lamb has a first down and more streaking
across the 45 chased down by Clowny
that's the next step Mike McCarthy wants
to see from him Blitz coming out of the
secondary he picks it up floated for
lamb adjust and makes the grab CD lamb
Big play after big play this one goes
for 28 his second consecutive third down
conversion and they're in a lot more
neutral Downs because the defense has
played a lot better which allows them to
lean on that run game couple big plays
on third down on this drive third and
four rush in zone lamb ad just in a
fitting way for this drive to end a CD
lamb
touchdown to throw the ball against you
to bring out the best of your defense
Boon again first down Carolina and
they've been the worst first quarter
team in the NFL and that's the key for
any relationship quarterback and
receiver situation he loves stealing
here third down he goes for him and it's
broken up and intercepted Jordan Lewis
got his hand on it Eric Kendrick picked
it off second D is takeaway of this
first
[Applause]
half here we go second and eight Blitz
coming they run away from it D slips him
in into the clear for a first down Rico
dle to the 35 and a gain of
10 Carolina not showing any pressure
here they dro seven into coverage Rush
finds lamb who had it popped out of
there by Josie juwel good first season
in Carolina for the longtime Bronco the
first guy in NFL history to have
multiple seasons of 10 plus makes from
50
hoam down the middle Brandon Aubrey
makes it 10 to nothing
Dallas that's the game Bryce Young's
trying to play at the line of scrimmage
seven of them Dro young collapsing
pocket keeps it alive stays downfield
with his eyes Lofts one liette goes up
to get it but
incomplete Cooper Rush shot of the gun
quick throw to cidd lamb who's been the
man again today the fifth catch for lamb
seven yds stopped by Mike
[Applause]
Jackson
Dow inside the 30 now rules expert Mike
Pereira taking a look at that last play
they can take something like this off if
there isn't contact to their head or
neck area I think we'll see that cidd
lamb quick throw first down cidd lamb to
the
22 Dallas trying to overcome another
penalty Rush given time Jake Ferguson
breaks a tackle Ferguson crashes close
to a first down Carolina trying to keep
this a two-score game going into the
break put on the ground and recovered by
Carolina DJ Johnson falls on the fumble
it's another Red Zone turnover for the
Cowboys Give It Away yourself 42 seconds
two timeouts see what Carolina can do
young goes up top and there's jayen
Coker the rookie in a foot race that
he'll win touchdown from
83 and this game takes a massive swing
in the blink of an eye
21 seconds so throw it again CD lamb
looking for room he's got it and
continues this monster first half to the
39 they're not that far from at least
trying it 15 seconds no
timeouts and Rush going to run it and
slide yes there you go that's the
panther logo but they got guys too deep
they got to get back 70 y would be an
NFL record Aubrey if anybody can do it
it'd be him but he hooks it and here
comes
topkins
topkins getar into the
sideline yeah taking it back to the 30
that was fun I mean we didn't get a
record and we didn't get a kick return
but it was a lot to talk about there 107
out of the pistol to begin this second
half with the throw and it's knocked out
and it's another turnover Osa oi zoa
drilled him and Dallas is on top of it
and Cooper Rush sees one high safety in
the middle the field right so as he
comes down if it's a pass he's been
throwing it to CD lamb do again big hole
left side lowers the shoulder can you
close games out when you have a lead
takes the fake here Rush sets his feet
back in the end zone jayen
tobert for the dallis
[Applause]
touchdown second touchdown pass of the
day for Cooper Rush fighting through it
kidding me second and 10 Young in
trouble o Diggy zua once again three
plays in this half and Osa oigi zua has
ruined them all Parson's
inside screen for thielen Adam thielen
needs the 40 needed too much he got 16
but they bring Turpin into the back
field
here and hand it to him kavante Turpin
has a hole breaks a tackle to juwel and
Turpin getting 15 yards they have a few
plays per game that they designed for
this guy as fast as any player in the
league first down from the Carolina
46 rush to throw steps up and delivers
to an open Cooks 18 yds another first
down and a week after that four sacks of
jayen Herz they don't have any against
Rush first down throw lamb breaks a
tackle gets another first down 11
more lamb goes out pumps short scan the
field got a man coming open in the back
of the end zone jayen
Brooks hangs on for the touchdown third
of the day for Cooper
rush to play outside the concept of the
play is a great job is in Phase another
way to say stationary that is a sack for
Parsons Micah Parsons from The Blind
Side of young everything going forward
now has got to be drop back pass and
it's tough bringing a blitz here young
is Zed by Jordan Lewis everybody getting
involved as Lewis the nickel gets the
[Applause]
sack that's tough one on second and
seven a low throw it's still caught by
Elliot Ezekiel Elliott makes a man miss
runs forward to the 42 got 12 16
consecutive regular season home games
coming in this year
one and six at home Rush delivers a
strike for a first down into Carolina
territory to Cooks 7even seed in the
playoffs and obviously this year has
been a mixed back dle dances his way
into space and accelerates for first
down the little burst for 12
more Turpin in the back field here his
second carry kavante Turin only needs a
little bit of space he gets through it
and gets another first down I mean you
blink and he's already at the first down
marker is he still coaching for his job
with his contract expiring at the end of
this year hit at the line of scrimmage
by DJ wo it's really hard to win in the
NFL and you got to make sure you have
somebody better to replace him with
that's the key Aubrey Bings it through
that you're going to fix the problems
that have held you back hovered for
first down you know and I think when you
look at this year it's it's been the
offense but outside of that one play it
just hasn't really been remotely
competitive going forward on fourth down
and converting with
Thelen Adam Thelen on third down gets 18
the competitive streak that we've seen
over the last five games two wins three
close losses it's kind of falling apart
today third and 12 young steps up
Parsons chases him and gets him the ball
is out trembles on top of it man it's as
good a product as it's ever been fourth
down 14 need to get to the 11 to keep
this drive going young throws into
double coverage and incomplete wanted
Coker going to get a first down anyways
flag
flying Young Moves off his spot directs
traffic runs towards the end zone and
he's in touchdown
Carolina third rushing score for Bryce
Young from the 39 back to dle he's got a
first down to the 30 nine wins in a row
though going into today's game lamb
can't catch his low throw from
Rush so it's Fourth and two sustained
Drive aided by a couple penalties from
Dallas Aubrey's got
his fourth make of the day so all 19 my
math stinks a lot just okay stay with
stick to
football uhoh sacked
again this time it's Carl Lawson getting
involved the six back of the day for
Dallas and Mike Zimmer even cracks a
little
smile so makes it third and 10 Dallas
bails out of a blitz look young over the
top it's picked off by
Mamu Israel Mamu the fourth takeaway of
the day for the
Cowboys big day for cidi lamb big day
for Cooper Rush with a three touchdown
passes season high for him and the
defense for the Cowboys stirs up Echoes
the previous Seasons a bunch of sacks
bunch of takeaways and a convincing win",""

offensive side of the football the
Giants are averaging just 10 points per
game at home this year as Graham g√≥
kicks it off and Justice Hill on the
return from his own four yd line hill
across the 30 got some room Hill in
Midfield and Hill finally out of bounds
in Giants territory a 59 yd return as
Lamar Jackson will start this drive at

Lamar at the 20 Jackson inside the 15
lost the football had it knocked out and
the Giants have it adori Jackson comes
away with it it's been a complicating
run situation with the ch of the
offensive line third and two empty
backfield DeVito Quick Pass way too high
and out of the reach of Tyrone
Tracy of their status on the team third
down and nine Jackson to the sideline
looking for flowers he's got it but he's
a little short of a first
down deito looking left now on the Move
rolling out right and throws this one
away so the Giants on again Baltimore
starts with great field position and
there he goes Lamar Jackson shoving
strowman out of
bounds Flowers In Motion it's Henry Derk
Henry at the 10 five still going down to
the three first and goal
Baltimore the ball is at the 13 yd line
third and goal play clock just about to
expire Jackson fires touchdown Mark
Andrews and that's is
40 second down and nine Giants will run
it with Tracy nice moves he's got the
first down cut from behind by tavius
Robinson but not before Tracy goes for
13 third down and four for deito and the
Giants play clock winding down he takes
the snap looking right the whole time
fires he's got the first down as Slayton
is still going and now Kyle vano and our
Darius
Washington eighth play of the drive
toito on the slant Robinson holds on to
it and he's a yard shy of a first down
veto under Center trying to push the
pile forward and he didn't get it unless
he gets a very generous

spot play Action Jackson has got Andrews
for a first
down a 12yd pickup for Mark Andrews
second and 10 Jackson to Isaiah
likeley and likele breaks a tackle and
picks up the first down mcfaden could
not bring him down they play the teams
that they have to play they're tied with
the Houston Texans record-wise going
into today Jackson looking deep down the
field baitman is wide open at the 10 at
the five and baitman gets in touchdown
Baltimore a 49 yd touchdown
[Applause]
second down and seven deito looking deep
for Neighbors nice catch along the
sideline neighbors for 14 and a first
down deito wide open is the tight end

down deito rolling left on the run and
it's caught by

Giants an 8 and 1/2 minute drive in the
Giants thanks to four Baltimore
penalties are on the scoreboard
Jackson screen to Hill blockers ahead
Hill has the first down and a stiff arm
as he goes out of
bounds Jackson with time and now dumps
it down to baitman who runs right up
ahead and picks up a first
down
Jackson out of the pocket
again buying time now coming back the
other way Lamar he's going to run it
he's got a lot of room to run into
Giants territory and still going Jackson
with a big one for
Baltimore terribly for his golf game
which is what he mostly cares about
these days third and one Hill no it's
Jackson he's got the first and Lamar
will go out of bounds as scored out by
pin right now Lamar is thinking points
second down and
nine Jackson into the end zone Batman's
down there he's got it
touchdown second of the day for Rashad
baitman and what a toss by
Lamar a couple of days later making his
Giants debut on second and 14 and he's
got a first down Malik neighbors through
the
defense Bole off his back foot looking
for Robinson incomplete Marlin Humphrey
nearly had an interception his legs keep
going third and one Henry slips another
tackle and picks up the first down Brian
Burns was in the back field made the

get a bunch of new games
headed our way.
And every month,
we try to sort through what's
the most worth talking about
at the very least.
Hi folks, it's Falcon.
And today on Gameranx,
the top 10 new games of December, 2024.
Starting off with number 10,
it's Alien: Rogue Incursion.
So this is a single player
action horror VR game,
comes to us by way of Survios.
Obviously, it's an Alien game,
so it's VR xenomorph stuff, you know?
If it's done well,
obviously that's gonna be good.
You take the role of Zula Hendricks,
a former marine turned mercenary.
You are actually not stuck
on a ship with xenomorphs.
Instead, you are infiltrating
a Wayland-Yutani facility
which has gone dark, wonder why.
But obviously, the point
here is immersion, it's VR,
so that's where we're going with this.
And I think there's
probably a decent chance
this type of thing allows us
to at least have a closer look at this.
It's got a character driven narrative,
which I think is an interesting idea,
actually deeply looking into a character.
I'll tell you, we've had some games
that really kinda skimp
on the narrative lately,
and I'm happy to see something here,
especially in a VR game.
Like the storytelling
potential for VR is very good,
and obviously Alien is a
great universe to do it in.
Alien: Rogue Incursion is
coming on December 19th
for the PlayStation VR2,
PC via Steam,
and also Meta Quest 3.
At number nine is Marvel Rivals,
a free-to-play, team-based PVP.
comes to us from NetEase Games
by way of Marvel, of course.
Essentially, it's a hero
shooter with Marvel characters,
which seems like a big no-brainer.
It's weird that it's taken this long,
if we're gonna be completely
honest, all right.
It's six V six,
they all got different powers.
It's Captain America, Ironman, Spider-Man,
all that type of stuff.
Magneto, Venom, yada, yada.
You got a bunch of different modes.
I mean, you know what a hero
shooter is at this point.
I don't really need to
describe it, in my opinion.
The main thing is the Marvel stuff.
They got some cool things.
You got Yggsgard, you got Tokyo from 2099.
Lots of that type of stuff.
It's pretty good looking,
like obviously they maintain
the sort of cartoony nature,
but it's also through Unreal Engine,
and we do get some pretty
nice aesthetic stuff.
Everything looks pretty well crafted,
and it's really if they
create a balanced shooter
that works with all these
different Marvel heroes.
I have pretty high hopes for it.
I really want it to be good,
which I know doesn't mean
it's going to be good,
but, I mean, I haven't seen anything
that makes it look like
it's gonna be not good.
So fingers are crossed, right?
Let's remain positive.
It's not exactly easy to
get a hero shooter going,
so let's all give it a chance,
at least if we're interested
in this sort of thing,
and I am.
Marvel Rivals is landing on PS5,
Xbox Series and PC December 6th.
At number eight
is Mighty Morphin Power
Rangers: Rita's Rewind,
a side scrolling adventure game
brought to us by Digital Eclipse.
So Rita Repulsa is now robot.
I'm not gonna tell you
if I think that's a good
thing or a bad thing
because I don't know.
But she develops a portal
to go back in time and
ally with her younger self
to prevent the Power
Rangers from happening,
thus we have a sort of
Turtles in Time premise
which gives us the ability
to play through a crazy
Power Rangers adventure,
side scroller, beat them up.
I mean, you know the type of game it is
from looking at this footage.
Hand drawn pixel art,
frankly it looks fun as hell.
I want to play it.
I will play it.
If the game is anything like this trailer,
and, I mean, you're not,
I don't think you're hearing it right now,
but there is really good
music in the trailer as well.
It calls right back to
Super Nintendo Brawlers.
But it's not just the side
scrolling, beat them up stuff,
it's also Dinozord, Megazord,
some forward scrolling 3D-ish type stuff
that I don't think you could
do on the Super Nintendo
and have it run as smoothly as it does.
But I don't care,
I wanna play it.
Look at it, look at it.
How could you not wanna play this?
Mighty Morphing Power
Rangers: Rita's Rewind
is coming to the PlayStations,
the Xboxes, Nintendo Switch and PC.
It's coming December 10th,
so keep your eyes peeled
if you wanna play that
one as much as I do.
At number seven, we have UFL,
which is actually a free
to play football game.
It's developed and published
by a company called Strikerz.
I'm not familiar with them.
That doesn't really matter.
This is, I mean, so this one
has my interest in particular
because they keep talking about
how it's going to be fair.
I have probably never in my
entire time doing Gameranx
seen a game advertised primarily
on the idea of being fair.
Now, it is a free-to-play game,
so that's a welcome talking point.
I have no complaints,
but it's just, it's jarring.
I've never like, well,
maybe it's jarring because
absolutely no free-to-play games
are what I would call
fair in a complete extent.
And they're just like touting it.
They're like, ""It's fair.""
They're even using the term fair-to-play.
I mean, if that doesn't
have you like intrigued
at least to some extent,
I don't know what will.
It looks like a pretty
normal football game to me.
Has online matches, uses Unreal 5,
so it's pretty.
But I just wanna see what's
different about a game
that's like we are working really hard
to make a fair video game.
Like the fact that's a
unique selling point,
the brand difference, so to speak,
that's a sorry state
for free-to-play games.
I'm gonna give them my
support just based on that,
I mean unless it turns out not to be fair,
in which case I'm gonna
call them Pretty Big Liars.
I hope it's a good game
because I like the idea of a
fair online free-to-play game,
and an alternative to EA's football games.
UFL is coming to PS5, Xbox
Series and PC, December 5th.
Moving on to number six,
we have Path of Exile 2,
the highly anticipated sequel
to the action RPG from
Grinding Gear Games.
It's gonna hit early access,
so it's not like a full release,
but, to be fair, Grinding Gear
has kind of never shortchanged anybody
with the early access.
I think it's probably gonna be quite good.
Path of Exile 2 brings us
a new six act campaign,
runs parallel to the
original game storyline,
which is interesting,
and actually has a shared
end game experience
with the first game.
We get new regions of Wraeclast,
we get new enemies, new quests.
Obviously, it's a different game,
but it's also the same game
because you get the
first game or something.
Doesn't really matter.
What matters
is that the first Path of
Exile campaign is great,
and this campaign is probably
also going to be great.
I think we're gonna
learn a lot of new things
about what happened in the
other version of the narrative,
and that's interesting to me.
It's also just more Path of Exile,
and Path of Exile's a great game.
This one's coming to
PC, PS5 and Xbox Series
on December 5th in early access.
At number five, we have Antonblast.
And honestly, I didn't
really hear a lot about this
until very recently,
and I think you're gonna very
obviously make the connection
that it looks a lot like Pizza Tower.
It is not affiliated with Pizza Tower.
It clearly draws some inspiration from it,
and also the games that
inspired Pizza Tower.
It does have that kinda Wario
but also kinda Sonic angle.
However, Antonblast is a
little bit more wide open
in terms of its levels,
like its levels look a
little bit more like courses.
And the idea is that
you should be destroying
as much as you possibly can.
You have a hammer,
you knock stuff over,
you defeat enemies.
You have to do the racing
back to the beginning of the level thing.
I mean, in a lot of ways,
it looks like Pizza Tower
with a focus on destruction.
I am kinda thinking it's not quite that,
but they haven't really done much
to make it seem like it's not that.
And even if it is that, it's fine.
I would love that.
I just have this weird hunch
there's something more to it.
And whether I'm right or wrong,
I'm probably gonna like this game.
It's frankly right up my alley.
And if it's right up your alley as well,
it's coming to Nintendo
Switch and PC on December 3rd.
At number four,
we have Legacy of Kain
Soul Reaver 1&2 Remastered.
And (chuckles) it's a Falcon month,
let's just say.
Like most people get really excited
about these big AAA
games with a ton of hype,
and that's where the most money is made.
But old Falcon gets excited
by shit like Antonblast and
old games being remastered
and Power Rangers beat them ups.
It's a Falcon month.
It's the 25th anniversary of
the original Soul Reaver game,
which is itself an
offshoot of Legacy of Kain.
But you play as Raziel obviously,
who is somebody who is not Kain,
who's actually betrayed by Kain.
He was a vampire,
but he's gotten resurrected as a wraith.
And basically, Raziel goes
off on a vengeance quest.
Basically, both of these
games are about fate
and free will and redemption,
those types of things.
And they're great.
They haven't been modified too much,
other than the character
models are definitely better.
They haven't been updated
to abandon like the
essence of the original.
Like if you ask me,
it's kind of what the
game would've looked like
if it wasn't PlayStation games.
You also get photo mode,
a supposedly improved camera system,
which the Legacy of Kain is
a game from the mid '90s.
Apparently, an improved camera system,
which is nice on account
these are PlayStation games.
I think you'll find that they're
oddly smooth for that time,
in terms of momentum.
I don't know, I love, I love Soul Reaver.
These are two great games,
and I am so excited to play them again.
They're coming to the PlayStations,
the Xboxes, Nintendo Switch
and PC on December 10th.
At number three, we have
Spirit of the Samurai,
A 2D action-adventure game
developed by Digital Mind,
published by Kwalee,
not aware of Kwalee,
doesn't matter, they're
the publisher, whatever.
It's basically a stop motion Metroidvania,
which is fricking crazy.
You take the role of Takeshi,
a Samurai tasked with
defending his village
from an onslaught of Oni
and their undead army.
Basically Japanese mythology stuff,
Tengu, undead creatures, blah, blah, blah.
But I gotta say what's
really particularly standout
about this is the stop motion animation.
To see a game look like this,
basically what they wished
ClayFighter would've looked like
way back in the day,
it's really impressive looking.
I don't know
if it's physically animated
stop motion animation,
but I have to say it looks great.
It's also got kind of, I
guess, a possession mechanism
where you can switch your spirit
between a cat and a tree spirit.
I don't fully understand that,
but it looks striking
and it's a Metroidvania.
And I'm really interested to
see how this one turns out,
just based on those things.
Like the sheer amount of effort
that would be put into this animation,
whether it is traditional
stop motion animation
or it's 3D modeling made to look like it,
it's quite a lot of work either way
to get something
that actually looks this
striking and cool looking.
The Spirit of the Samurai
is coming out on PC, December 12th.
At number two, we have Delta Force,
a free-to-play first person
tactical shooter from Team Jade.
This is a reboot and a return
of the classic Delta Force series.
And they're probably gonna have to try
to balance the nostalgia and
some modern gameplay stuff.
The fact that it's free to play
should be probably intriguing to people,
and it's a cause for concern, to be frank.
I don't exactly view
free-to-play as not a red flag,
but also it's Delta Force,
so I don't know.
There is both single
player and multiplayer,
which I'm pretty happy with.
There's actually two
distinct timelines as well.
In 1993, you're basically
playing through a campaign
that reconstructs Delta
Force: Black Hawk Down,
except for obviously it looks like this.
And then also one that
takes place in 2035.
You're a private military company,
and there's futuristic stuff in that.
But also, I mean, this is
probably what most people
are interested in,
based on the fact that
it's been a very long time
since the Delta Force game.
There's gonna be large
scale multiplayer battles,
and they're gonna have vehicles
including helicopters and tanks.
And frankly, just looking
at it, I'm kinda hyped.
I don't know if I wanna get hyped
about a free-to-play thing,
but also maybe they'll
do it and it won't be bad
because when they
responsibly do free-to-play,
I don't care.
It looks quality.
So I'm just hoping
that the fact that they made
something that looks good
pairs with the hope
that they made a responsible
free-to-play game.
Anyway, Delta Force is coming out on PC,
and it is coming to early
access December 5th.
And finally at number one,
it's Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.
Let's just be clear here,
this is probably the only
AAA release of the month.
We've mostly talked indies and AAs here.
And again, that's a Falcon month.
Also I fricking love MachineGames.
The Wolfenstein Games nail
it in every possible way.
I go back to those fairly often,
and somehow it looks like
they made a first person whipping game.
I don't, I don't know,
I don't think that's the primary
thing that's going on here.
It's some kind of a
first person action game.
You got puzzle solving in it
as much as you have combat.
So I don't know exactly
what you're gonna call it,
but I don't care.
It's Indiana Jones, it's MachineGames,
and it looks like they figured
out how to make this work.
All of the gameplay I've
seen of this looks great,
and it's also got that impact
that very few developers
really know how to do.
It's something about the
animation and the sound design.
When stuff happens in
the Wolfenstein games,
it really happens.
Like if you punch somebody,
it's like (imitates punching),
like, well, it sounds nothing like that.
You know what it sounds like though
if you've played those games,
it sticks in your head
because they're just such a
satisfying, tactile experience,
and that's why they were perfect
for an Indiana Jones adventure.
This particular story takes place
between Raiders of the Lost
Ark and the Last Crusade.
You know what you're
getting with Indiana Jones.
And Troy Baker's doing a
damn good Harrison Ford.
I mean, this game just looks fun as hell.
You're doing a bunch of
high octane action stuff.
You're using the whip as a weapon.
You're also using it to grab onto stuff.
It switches into third person when that,
I mean, everything about this
looks like a hell of a lot of fun to me.
Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
is launching on Xbox Series
and PC on December 9th.
There is a PlayStation 5 version coming,
but that is later, in spring 2025.
I'm absolutely picking this up.
It looks incredibly fun.
I do have a few bonus games for you.
Skydance's BEHEMOTH,
a big action adventure game
that aims to immerse players
in a savage, primal world
with breathtaking visuals,
brutal combat and a
big old fricking enemy.
Like look at him.
There's a reason why
Behemoth is in the title.
It's coming to PC and PS5, December 5th.
Stranger Things VR.
You're playing as Vecna in
a upside down adventure.
Not something I actually ever
thought I would be seeing,
but an intriguing concept.
That's coming to PC and PS5, December 5th.
Next, we've got FANTASIAN Neo Dimension.
A reimagining of the beloved RPG,
giving you new dimensions, expanded worlds
and obviously way better
graphics than the original.
That's coming to PC, the PlayStations,
the Xboxes and even Nintendo
Switch on December 5th.
And finally, Diesel
Legacy: The Brazen Age,
a Dieselpunk inspired fighting game
that brings a pretty
different looking aesthetic
for what we expect from a fighting game,
but also, according to the developers,
some unique mechanics and
a gritty presentation.
That's coming to PC, the PlayStations,
the Xboxes and Nintendo
Switch sometime in December.
That's all for today.

completions tough down a distance third
and 10 Richardson slinging one in
complete so far this season third and
10 Taylor on the take Taylor first down
boy interesting play call on a third and
10 10 play of the drive for the Colts
this is Richardson the Slate of hand
he's got the room Richardson in
touchdown and the Indianapolis Colts
Throw Down The Gauntlet here in Denver
and they've got to find a way to get off
the
field Nicks on third and four going to
work from the gun over the middle on a
cross first down
Denver what a tantm they have been in
the middle of that Colts defense third
and
five Nicks going to scramble Nicks first
down
Denver plenty of green grass going to
get inside Colts territory but that time
the perfect defense and he picks it up
nicks's pass is picked and it's Frank
lton is going to be huge for a young
Young quarterback Richardson on Third
and five over the middle and again
threads the needle how about this start
from Richardson he finds Pitman over the
middle has done an excellent job
stuffing the run as well Colts go for it
pits to Taylor they've got it it would
have been about a 50 7yd field goal
attempt from that spot and somehow make
Richardson speed up his process would be
about a 51y field goal from here Taylor
on a third and N Taylor finding the edge
boys out of bounds did he get enough and
now they're going to say first down
Colts nothing but Sun temperatures right
around 50¬∞ third and five for the Colts
as they work inside the Broncos 20 as
their red zone offense perform
Richardson slinging it deflected and
incomplete
looking for the tight end kylin Granton
right over the middle of the field keep
in mind still no Riley Moss for Denver's
defense here's Matt gay at end of the
day hitting 10 straight field goal all
those games some big big games playoff
implications in the late window today
around the league Nicks on second and
four favorable down in distance everyone
covered and so Nicks with another first
down scramble third and six can Denver
extend this drive already down two
scores Nicks protected now here they
come and nicks is
buried DeForest Buckner coming with some
serious heat for the Colts but don't
make a mistake at least end this drive
in a punt Broncos lead the lead in sacks
here they come Richardson that pass boy
he ripped it back Richardson going to
just barely try to get back to the line
of scrimmage you could almost hear the
gasp from that CT sideline Nicks hasn't
had a chance to really get comfortable
yet in the pocket this is Mims and Mims
has a Denver first
down probably one of the biggest plays
of the game was the interception by
Blackman on the one yd line that was
forced by Franklin on second and 10
Nicks to the end zone touchdown it's
troan for
315 yards most of it because of
communication air Richardson rips it
back Richardson boy he is a daunting
player staring down at
defense and Franklin Meers needs a
breather on that sideline but this is
what it is with Richardson 6'4 nearly
250 lb of muscle Richardson puts a air
under it Richardson's pass and it is
picked Brandon Jones with a snatch for
Denver B Nick's going to work from the
shotgun
Colts rush for Nicks completes but
they're going to be buried Lucas coll
the tight end wrapped up by Sam wac
going to get the ball with pretty good
field position two timeouts left and
about a minute 45 so the Colts use their
first time
out and they're going to be in pretty
good position here
gold Fielding the punt gold weaving his
way through traffic gold Breaking Free
inside Denver territory and boy he
nearly broke it a 37 yd return
Richardson really had a couple of good
throws but has really started to cool
off here in the second quarter
Richardson faking to Taylor feels the
pressure gets it out this is granson
granson first down Colts going to get
all the way down inside the 30 close to
the
25 and so they're going to have to hold
up against a fiveman pressure look would
be about a 50-yard field goal from here
Richardson takes his shot to the end
zone broken up and
incomplete Chris Abrams
drain with a sensational play against
Pierce Luke rhods is the Snapper Sanchez
the holder the operation is sound and
Matt gay money in the bank for the
[Applause]
Colts third and one they go play action
here Nicks up the seam Nicks is picked
again it's
wac Nicks again overshooting his
intended target who was suting on that
play over threw the corner route for the
interception so here's Richardson who
was just six of 17 throwing in the first
half Taylor breaking away Taylor
touchdown a 41 yd Sprint for for Taylor
who was basically
untouched and then Taylor Just winds it
back and ends up hitting the crease but
look at the tight ends look at Mo Ali
Cox look at Ogle tree and then somehow
Taylor who had a big workload his
biggest workload of the season last week
against New England boy if you're a
Colts fan I hope you're sitting down the
Jonathan Taylor touchdown run over
turned dropped the football before he
crossed the plane looks like they're
going with a four-man run
Colt State conservative and Taylor is
going nowhere there is a flag thrown
from behind the line of scrimmage he's
the one that really comes comes in on
base
packages uh not the three receiver sets
Nicks with that pass and it's picked off
Nick cross into the passing
Lane so after the third interception of
bone Knicks Richardson and Company back
onto the field Richardson somehow gets
it out to p and then the football comes
out and Denver has
it
unreal DJ Jones with the
recovery would be about a 46-yard field
goal attempt from here Nicks climbs the
pocket underneath as he goes to the
check here but again the Colts were
there wac has been all over the place
perfect over his last three games eight
of eight having the best season for him
since 2018 good snap good hold and let's
gets the Denver Broncos a little bit
closer San one of the highest graded
players in the sport third and 15
Broncos coming Richardson tough angle on
the pass to Mitchell and it's
incomplete javante Williams back onto
the field he's lined up at the top of
your picture for
Denver Nicks on second and nine
completes over the middle this is the
tight end
croll trying to extend for the first
down appears to be a little bit short
now you're sitting here at third and
short that was a positive play Nicks on
the keeper first down
Broncos Broncos important to just get
enough so you have a field goal attempt
they're out of range at this point and
that pass for Sutton is low and
incomplete but neither team has been
able to capitalize
much Richardson boy Cooper wasn't fooled
they blow it up on a third and three to
start the fourth quarter
and Jonathan Cooper makes that play So
they lose five on a third and three
Sanchez forced the
punt Mims going to play it from around
his own 25 Mims has some real estate
comes across the field he's got a lead
blocker Mims gets it inside the 25 Mims
finally brought down at the
15 oh
smokes Marvin Mims Jr bringing the Colts
to their knees I'm attacking the game
this year guys that's exactly what we
just saw well pro pro bowler his return
man last year big play out of the back
field it's the fullback Atkins and he
punches it in can hit some quick hitters
or use the Run game or quarterback run
game they set up Mitchell it's going to
be a double pass and that one is
intercepted it's Bonito
unbelievable listen they they've had to
try to do something unconventional
because they just haven't been able to
get it
done but they they didn't account for
Nick Nick Bonito two in a row two in a
row he did it
against outside of a couple of runs has
been lights out and made it really tough
for Anthony Richardson how do the Cults
respond after their fourth giveaway of
the day Pitman wide open down to his
knees to make that catch either going to
bring an allout Blitz to force the ball
out fast or put a spy on Richardson what
have they dialed up here Richardson
wobbly pass and it's
incomplete looking for
Downs execute Under Pressure make him
make a tight
throw he rushes
for Nicks and it's batted down at the
line of scrimmage huge play by Grover
Stewart and what they've had to contend
with over the last month do they have
some late game magic up their sleeve
Richardson
completes finding granson who takes a
hard hit at the end of that play from PJ
L how about the bills going to Detroit
and putting up 40 plus against that
Lions team unbelievable oh that pass
from Richardson is
intercepted San we'll check the flag
here Micks on a third and six going back
towards the end zone Sutton all by
himself for the
touchdown a 20 yd strike from
Nicks 509 left in regulation here Denver
brancos looking for what would be a
fourth straight win Richard wobbly pass
gets it to
[Applause]
Gould a tremendous second half but boy
the Colts had a golden opportunity with
that 40 yd run Pitman contested catch
short of the line the gain so it's going
to be fourth down for the Colts like you
said the short week I mean this uh that
could be huge that's that's one player
that they cannot
afford indispensable piece on their
defense
well you got to give him a lot of credit
sparo it wasn't easy and the Colts
certainly made it tough on him and again
boy hats off to Mims that punt return
how big and how electric was that punt
return for this football team",""

is always when we find out
about a ton of new games.
This game awards absolutely
did not disappoint. Hi folks.
It's Falcon and today on GameRanx,
the top 20 brand new games
of the Game Awards 2024.
Starting off at number
20, ""Viking's Destiny"",
a survival strategy, role playing game,
putting you in the role
of a Viking Clan leader.
Basically, your goal is
to expand the settlement
and lead everybody to prosperity.
You want to help all the
other Vikings win at life.
This game's gonna have
a dynamic season system
and the changing weather's
gonna significantly impact
gameplay, particularly in
the survival direction.
Looks like an interesting game.
""Viking's Destiny"" is
coming to PC in 2025.
And number 19 is ""Thick as
Thieves"", a co-op heist adventure
where you assemble a
crew of skilled criminals
to pull off high stakes robberies.
They're touting an adaptive AI system,
which is interesting on account
now that AI mania is happening,
games are talking about their AI again.
Maybe NPC AI is about to
get interesting again.
That would be nice.
""Thick as Thieves"" doesn't
have a release date,
but it's coming to PC,
PS5, and Xbox series.
And number 18 is ""Stage Fright"",
an atmospheric horror game.
Interesting concept.
You're a theater performer.
No one more haunted than
those, actually, I'm joking.
They're usually some of the
least haunted souls in the
world, but this particular one is haunted
by mysterious ghosties during rehearsals.
But I think the claim
to fame here is the fact
that the game is going to
integrate real time voice
recognition, and it's not going
to just extend a voice commands.
You're gonna have to sing.
Horror games often force people
to overcome their fears in certain ways.
This is a new one, and if you play this
with other people in the house,
how many people are gonna play this game
and be like, (quietly)
here I go again, my, oh,
going down the only road I've ever known.
(normal) I dunno, this is a cool concept.
It doesn't have a release date,
but it's coming to PC
sometime in the future.
And number 17 is ""Screamer"" a racing game,
which is touting itself as
having chaotic tracks filled
with hazards and shortcuts.
Of course, the idea
of a game called
""Screamer"" better be Speed
and it apparently is, they're
introducing something they're
calling the Rage Boost Mechanic,
which rewards aggressive
driving with temporary bursts
of speed, which I mean,
I get a rage boost when I
am driving in real life,
typically doesn't mean that,
but that sounds like a good mechanic.
""Screamer"" is coming to PC,
PS5, and Xbox Series in 2026.
And number 16 is ""Shadow
Labyrinth"", a dark fantasy RPG,
in which players will be
exploring a sprawling labyrinth,
allegedly uncovering the
mysteries of a Cursed Rome.
Oh, and it's a Pacman
game, just so you know.
It's kind of like a Pacman
went Hollow night. I guess.
The Amazon Secret Levels
anthology episode based on Pacman
is actually based on this game,
which has been in
development for four years.
Looks completely insane,
honestly for a Pacman game.
Also just looks like a
pretty decent metroid venue.
Honestly, I like the
style of the graphics.
Shadow Labyrinth is coming to PC, PS5,
Xbox Series, and Switch 2025.
And number 15 is ""Dave
the Diver: In the Jungle"",
the highly anticipated
sequel to the hit indie game.
This time Dave trades the ocean
for a lush jungle river system.
I mean, it's not gonna be
fundamentally a different game
here, but I mean there's a lot
of different stuff about
jungle rivers versus the ocean.
Plus it seems like there's gonna be
some tree climbing as well.
So in some ways this may be
a lot more varied of a game.
""Dave the Diver: In the
Jungle"" is coming to PC,
the PlayStation and Nintendo
switch sometime next year.
And number 14 is ""Backfrosts:
That Long Dark 2""
the highly anticipated sequel.
Of course, the underlying
concept obviously isn't gonna
change a whole lot in Backfrosts.
It's post-apocalyptic, it's frozen.
You're gonna have to manage resources
and navigate harsh conditions.
Obviously a big staple is
the weather and ecosystems,
but now you're gonna be dealing
with multi-region expeditions
where you're gonna have
to survive across interconnected maps.
There's also gonna be co-op gameplay
and an expanded crafting system,
so it looks like it's
meaningfully building on
the original.
Backfrost is coming
exclusively to PC in 2026.
And number 13 is ""Solasta 2"", the sequel
to the highly acclaimed tactical RPG.
Solasta, obviously not abandoning
the adaption at tabletop
RPG mechanics anytime soon.
What they're intending
to do here is make it so
that there's deeper
character customization.
They're thrown in some new classes,
but probably what sets
it apart is the overhaul
dungeon creation tools, making
it so that players can craft
and share intricate, story-driven
adventures with the community.
And obviously with tabletop roots,
that's the way you want to
go, that's what you want
to develop as you make sequels
to your successful RPGs.
""Solasta 2"" is coming to
PC sometime next year.
And number 12 is ""Project
Century"" an Action Adventure Game,
coming to us from the
creators of the Yakuza series.
This one, however, is
not set in the, well,
I guess semi present day.
It is set in 1915 Japan,
and it gives us a grittier
and more visceral version of the real time
Yakuza type combat.
I don't know. To me it looks
cool as hell. I like it.
It looks like the intent
is to explore the origins
of Japanese organized crime
during Japan's transition to modernity.
We don't have a release date,
but it is coming to PS5,
Xbox Series, and PC.
At number 11, there is a new
""Virtual Fighter"" project,
which is kind of fricking crazy.
Virtual Fighter's been
dead for a long time
for the most part, but then
Sega is starting to realize
that they literally own
a mountain of gold in all
of their various IPs.
It's been over a decade,
but it's just exciting to see
that they're making a virtual fighter game
with modern enhancements.
This was a trailblazer as
far as 3D fighting games go.
It set the tone, the pace, everything.
It was pretty much this
and Tekken, like that's
how big Virtual Fighter was.
I'm excited to play a new
Virtual Fighter game in
2025 when it's supposed to come out.
We don't know what platforms.
Moving on to number 10, it's
""Rematch"", a new football slash
soccer game from the creators
of Sifu, which is, I mean, not
what I would expect
for their next project.
It is, however, a completely
different take on soccer.
Like they're not trying
to be super realistic.
It's a very arcade-y
looking game, honestly.
I think it's really freaking cool looking.
It's hard to get me super excited about
a soccer/football game.
Not 'cause I don't like 'em
or anything, it's just, they're
usually just yearly update
roster and minor visual change type games.
This, it looks completely different.
I'm so excited for this.
I'm definitely going to play it.
We don't know exactly when,
but it is coming to PS5, Xbox Series,
and PC sometime next year.
And number nine is ""Turok
Origins"", reimagining
of the Dinosaur Hunter.
It's a prequel. It explores
the origins of Turok, which is,
I always think it's really
funny when the prequel
is like way, way better
looking than the original,
but it does look like they're
incorporating survival
elements, crafting tools,
setting traps, et cetera.
I don't know how far they're
gonna drift exactly from the
gameplay of the original.
""Turok"" is, it's a
different beast, let's say,
bit of a standout in more than one way.
I'm interested to see how this one goes.
It's coming to PC, PS5,
and Xbox series, sometime we
don't have a release date.
And number eight is ""Ninja
Gaiden: Rage Bound"". Come on man.
We've been wanting a
""Ninja Gaiden"" for a while.
Now ""Rage Bound"", of course,
referring to the fact
that they are leaning in
to the high speed combat.
They are re-imagining it,
wanting to blend something
classic with something modern.
Obviously that is sometimes a great idea
and sometimes not the best,
I'm guessing based on this trailer.
They know what they're doing.
I like the idea, ""Rage Bound""
is referring to the fact
that you can build up rage through combat,
which unlocks big old cinematic techniques
and makes it look even
that much more insane.
Like, ""Ninja Gaiden"" is a
traditionally pretty insane game.
I'm excited. This is coming to PC,
the PlayStations, Xbox Series,
and Nintendo Switch later in 2025.
And number seven is ""Gendesign"".
A fairly mysterious project
coming to us from the creators
of ""Shadow of the Colossus""
and ""The Last Guardian"".
We don't know the name of the game.
Gendesign is the name of the
developer. I mean, at once,
this trailer looks very familiar
and completely unfamiliar.
It shows an adventurer climbing up a robot
and then blasting off with its head
to escape some insane storm
and maybe does, but kind of doesn't.
I don't know. It was really cool.
That's all we know about it right now.
But yes, absolutely, 100%.
We don't have a release date
or platforms or anything.
We just have this trailer
and it's a good trailer,
at least, if you know
what ""Shadow of the Colossus""
and ""Last Guardian"" are, I
imagine if you didn't know
what they are, you'd just be confused.
But I think very familiar
and yet very new looking.
And number six is ""Dispatch"",
a narrative driven game
where you play as an emergency dispatcher.
You make critical decisions
that will either save
or not save people's lives.
It's an interesting looking game.
Definitely something
different, like at once,
it feels kind of like a
telltale game combined
with a management sim of some kind,
but doesn't really look
like either of those things,
visually speaking.
I'm super interested
in where this one goes.
It's coming to PC sometime next year.
And number five is
""Onimusha: Way of the Sword""
I swear, it's basically like
we didn't have that great
of a 2024 guys,
let's announce a bunch of
stuff that you guys want
for the next two years.
Stay involved guys.
It's about to get good.
I mean, I don't really know what
to say about this other than
it's gonna be an Onimusha game
with modern graphics and mechanics.
It looks like they want some timing
and technique type stuff.
Real integrated here.
So a little bit of soul's influence,
but I have a feeling that it's
gonna be, you know, Onimusha.
Onimusha is a pretty distinct game.
That's why everybody wants more of it.
And they're gonna get it in
2026 on PC, PS5, & Xbox Series.
And number four is ""Split Fiction"",
a narrative-driven, action
adventure game set in parallel
dimensions where you're
gonna be alternating
between two versions of the
protagonist, each frankly,
with different abilities and story arcs,
still the same person, of course.
The whole idea is this split reality thing
that's gonna involve
interlocking dimensions
where like puzzles and events
take place across multiple
dimensions and affect each other.
I don't know, it looks interesting.
Split fiction is also the
first game we're talking about
today that has a release date.
It's coming to PC, PlayStation 5,
and Xbox Series, March 6th, 2025.
And number three is an
""Okami"" sequel as if Onimusha
and Ninja Guide weren't enough.
We're getting a new freaking Okami game.
A lot of information
on this is under wraps.
We just know it's coming at this point.
But mythological storytelling,
beautiful cell shaded art,
and intricate ways of interacting
with the environment
wrapped up into a heartfelt
and mystical story.
I'm all here for it.
How could you not want more of this?
Well, maybe you never played the original,
it was a while ago, but
man, was it a good game?
I'm excited for Okami
sequel, let me tell you.
And number two is ""Elden Ring Nightreign"".
Let me tell you, missed opportunity
to use the Guns N Roses song
""Night Train"", basically
sounds like the same word,
would've been a high octane trailer,
especially for a roguelike,
which is what this is,
essentially a multiplayer
roguelike set in an
alternate version of the lands between,
introducing an eclipse
cycle, which is going
to change enemy behavior,
environmental hazards,
even quest lines.
And it looks like a pretty
interesting game to me.
It's an expansion,
obviously on the original.
I assume it's gonna use a
lot of the original's assets,
but it's definitely a new twist on it
and I'm excited for that.
It's coming next year
to PC, the PlayStations,
and the Xboxes.
So stay tuned for more info on that.
And finally at number one,
a brand new game/IP from Naughty Dog.
A new sci-fi RPG called
""Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet"".
Sounds pretty awesome, honestly.
There's a big old interstellar theocracy.
Not always a good thing,
often bad, often bad.
You're gonna set that right though,
or at least set it different, I guess.
Sounds like a lot of moral ambiguity type
stuff going on here.
But you're a renegade prophet
and they're dropping you
into this big player driven
narrative type thing.
You are gonna be the spark
that lights the fire, so to speak.
You're gonna cause some rebellion, my man.
It's a big old galactic oppressive
institution that you fight against story.
Let's go right? It's Naughty Dog.
We don't have any kind of a release date,
but it is a PS5 exclusive.
I'm excited for it.
Can't wait to hear more.
I have a few bonus games for you,
""Kura"", an exploration adventure game
where you're exploring
this hand-painted world,
unraveling the mysteries
of an ancient civilization.
Looks heavy on environmental
storytelling, coming out to PC,
don't have a date for that.
Next is ""Sonic Racing: Crossworlds"",
a cross platform, cross
dimensional Sonic racer coming
to pretty much everything, but
we don't know exactly when.
And ""Game of Thrones: Kingsroad"",
a narrative driven strategy
game set in where else?
Westeros, where you'll be
focusing on building alliances
and subverting political intrigue in order
to gain control of the Iron Throne.
This one, we don't know when,
but it is coming in
2025, to what platforms?
I'm not sure. However,
it does look pretty cool.
I don't know.
The game awards, definitely a
stacked presentation I think.
I think pretty awesome slate
of new stuff on the way.

is always when we find out
about a ton of new games.
This game awards absolutely
did not disappoint. Hi folks.
It's Falcon and today on GameRanx,
the top 20 brand new games
of the Game Awards 2024.
Starting off at number
20, ""Viking's Destiny"",
a survival strategy, role playing game,
putting you in the role
of a Viking Clan leader.
Basically, your goal is
to expand the settlement
and lead everybody to prosperity.
You want to help all the
other Vikings win at life.
This game's gonna have
a dynamic season system
and the changing weather's
gonna significantly impact
gameplay, particularly in
the survival direction.
Looks like an interesting game.
""Viking's Destiny"" is
coming to PC in 2025.
And number 19 is ""Thick as
Thieves"", a co-op heist adventure
where you assemble a
crew of skilled criminals
to pull off high stakes robberies.
They're touting an adaptive AI system,
which is interesting on account
now that AI mania is happening,
games are talking about their AI again.
Maybe NPC AI is about to
get interesting again.
That would be nice.
""Thick as Thieves"" doesn't
have a release date,
but it's coming to PC,
PS5, and Xbox series.
And number 18 is ""Stage Fright"",
an atmospheric horror game.
Interesting concept.
You're a theater performer.
No one more haunted than
those, actually, I'm joking.
They're usually some of the
least haunted souls in the
world, but this particular one is haunted
by mysterious ghosties during rehearsals.
But I think the claim
to fame here is the fact
that the game is going to
integrate real time voice
recognition, and it's not going
to just extend a voice commands.
You're gonna have to sing.
Horror games often force people
to overcome their fears in certain ways.
This is a new one, and if you play this
with other people in the house,
how many people are gonna play this game
and be like, (quietly)
here I go again, my, oh,
going down the only road I've ever known.
(normal) I dunno, this is a cool concept.
It doesn't have a release date,
but it's coming to PC
sometime in the future.
And number 17 is ""Screamer"" a racing game,
which is touting itself as
having chaotic tracks filled
with hazards and shortcuts.
Of course, the idea
of a game called
""Screamer"" better be Speed
and it apparently is, they're
introducing something they're
calling the Rage Boost Mechanic,
which rewards aggressive
driving with temporary bursts
of speed, which I mean,
I get a rage boost when I
am driving in real life,
typically doesn't mean that,
but that sounds like a good mechanic.
""Screamer"" is coming to PC,
PS5, and Xbox Series in 2026.
And number 16 is ""Shadow
Labyrinth"", a dark fantasy RPG,
in which players will be
exploring a sprawling labyrinth,
allegedly uncovering the
mysteries of a Cursed Rome.
Oh, and it's a Pacman
game, just so you know.
It's kind of like a Pacman
went Hollow night. I guess.
The Amazon Secret Levels
anthology episode based on Pacman
is actually based on this game,
which has been in
development for four years.
Looks completely insane,
honestly for a Pacman game.
Also just looks like a
pretty decent metroid venue.
Honestly, I like the
style of the graphics.
Shadow Labyrinth is coming to PC, PS5,
Xbox Series, and Switch 2025.
And number 15 is ""Dave
the Diver: In the Jungle"",
the highly anticipated
sequel to the hit indie game.
This time Dave trades the ocean
for a lush jungle river system.
I mean, it's not gonna be
fundamentally a different game
here, but I mean there's a lot
of different stuff about
jungle rivers versus the ocean.
Plus it seems like there's gonna be
some tree climbing as well.
So in some ways this may be
a lot more varied of a game.
""Dave the Diver: In the
Jungle"" is coming to PC,
the PlayStation and Nintendo
switch sometime next year.
And number 14 is ""Backfrosts:
That Long Dark 2""
the highly anticipated sequel.
Of course, the underlying
concept obviously isn't gonna
change a whole lot in Backfrosts.
It's post-apocalyptic, it's frozen.
You're gonna have to manage resources
and navigate harsh conditions.
Obviously a big staple is
the weather and ecosystems,
but now you're gonna be dealing
with multi-region expeditions
where you're gonna have
to survive across interconnected maps.
There's also gonna be co-op gameplay
and an expanded crafting system,
so it looks like it's
meaningfully building on
the original.
Backfrost is coming
exclusively to PC in 2026.
And number 13 is ""Solasta 2"", the sequel
to the highly acclaimed tactical RPG.
Solasta, obviously not abandoning
the adaption at tabletop
RPG mechanics anytime soon.
What they're intending
to do here is make it so
that there's deeper
character customization.
They're thrown in some new classes,
but probably what sets
it apart is the overhaul
dungeon creation tools, making
it so that players can craft
and share intricate, story-driven
adventures with the community.
And obviously with tabletop roots,
that's the way you want to
go, that's what you want
to develop as you make sequels
to your successful RPGs.
""Solasta 2"" is coming to
PC sometime next year.
And number 12 is ""Project
Century"" an Action Adventure Game,
coming to us from the
creators of the Yakuza series.
This one, however, is
not set in the, well,
I guess semi present day.
It is set in 1915 Japan,
and it gives us a grittier
and more visceral version of the real time
Yakuza type combat.
I don't know. To me it looks
cool as hell. I like it.
It looks like the intent
is to explore the origins
of Japanese organized crime
during Japan's transition to modernity.
We don't have a release date,
but it is coming to PS5,
Xbox Series, and PC.
At number 11, there is a new
""Virtual Fighter"" project,
which is kind of fricking crazy.
Virtual Fighter's been
dead for a long time
for the most part, but then
Sega is starting to realize
that they literally own
a mountain of gold in all
of their various IPs.
It's been over a decade,
but it's just exciting to see
that they're making a virtual fighter game
with modern enhancements.
This was a trailblazer as
far as 3D fighting games go.
It set the tone, the pace, everything.
It was pretty much this
and Tekken, like that's
how big Virtual Fighter was.
I'm excited to play a new
Virtual Fighter game in
2025 when it's supposed to come out.
We don't know what platforms.
Moving on to number 10, it's
""Rematch"", a new football slash
soccer game from the creators
of Sifu, which is, I mean, not
what I would expect
for their next project.
It is, however, a completely
different take on soccer.
Like they're not trying
to be super realistic.
It's a very arcade-y
looking game, honestly.
I think it's really freaking cool looking.
It's hard to get me super excited about
a soccer/football game.
Not 'cause I don't like 'em
or anything, it's just, they're
usually just yearly update
roster and minor visual change type games.
This, it looks completely different.
I'm so excited for this.
I'm definitely going to play it.
We don't know exactly when,
but it is coming to PS5, Xbox Series,
and PC sometime next year.
And number nine is ""Turok
Origins"", reimagining
of the Dinosaur Hunter.
It's a prequel. It explores
the origins of Turok, which is,
I always think it's really
funny when the prequel
is like way, way better
looking than the original,
but it does look like they're
incorporating survival
elements, crafting tools,
setting traps, et cetera.
I don't know how far they're
gonna drift exactly from the
gameplay of the original.
""Turok"" is, it's a
different beast, let's say,
bit of a standout in more than one way.
I'm interested to see how this one goes.
It's coming to PC, PS5,
and Xbox series, sometime we
don't have a release date.
And number eight is ""Ninja
Gaiden: Rage Bound"". Come on man.
We've been wanting a
""Ninja Gaiden"" for a while.
Now ""Rage Bound"", of course,
referring to the fact
that they are leaning in
to the high speed combat.
They are re-imagining it,
wanting to blend something
classic with something modern.
Obviously that is sometimes a great idea
and sometimes not the best,
I'm guessing based on this trailer.
They know what they're doing.
I like the idea, ""Rage Bound""
is referring to the fact
that you can build up rage through combat,
which unlocks big old cinematic techniques
and makes it look even
that much more insane.
Like, ""Ninja Gaiden"" is a
traditionally pretty insane game.
I'm excited. This is coming to PC,
the PlayStations, Xbox Series,
and Nintendo Switch later in 2025.
And number seven is ""Gendesign"".
A fairly mysterious project
coming to us from the creators
of ""Shadow of the Colossus""
and ""The Last Guardian"".

That's all we know about it right now.
But yes, absolutely, 100%.
We don't have a release date
or platforms or anything.
We just have this trailer
and it's a good trailer,
at least, if you know
what ""Shadow of the Colossus""
and ""Last Guardian"" are, I
imagine if you didn't know
what they are, you'd just be confused.
But I think very familiar
and yet very new looking.
And number six is ""Dispatch"",
a narrative driven game
where you play as an emergency dispatcher.
You make critical decisions
that will either save
or not save people's lives.
It's an interesting looking game.
Definitely something
different, like at once,
it feels kind of like a
telltale game combined
with a management sim of some kind,
but doesn't really look
like either of those things,
visually speaking.
I'm super interested
in where this one goes.
It's coming to PC sometime next year.
And number five is
""Onimusha: Way of the Sword""
I swear, it's basically like
we didn't have that great
of a 2024 guys,
let's announce a bunch of
stuff that you guys want
for the next two years.
Stay involved guys.
It's about to get good.

Onimusha is a pretty distinct game.
That's why everybody wants more of it.
And they're gonna get it in
2026 on PC, PS5, & Xbox Series.
And number four is ""Split Fiction"",
a narrative-driven, action
adventure game set in parallel

protagonist, each frankly,
with different abilities and story arcs,

The whole idea is this split reality thing

Split fiction is also the
first game we're talking about
today that has a release date.
It's coming to PC, PlayStation 5,
and Xbox Series, March 6th, 2025.
And number three is an
""Okami"" sequel as if Onimusha

We're getting a new freaking Okami game.

In seinem Retro Review zeigt Jasper, dass VAMPIRE: THE MASQUERADE - BLOODLINES damals zum Launch vielleicht ein komplett mit Bugs verseuchter Flop war, im Kern aber durchaus Potential hatte und bis heute eine treue Fanbase um sich versammelt - zu Recht!

Ebenfalls hoch im Kurs bei Fans steht Microsofts Flight Simulator der mit MICROSOFT FLIGHT SIMULATOR 2024 dieses Jahr ein Update bekommen, das anfangs aber eher ein Downgrade war. Denn die Server spielten am Release nicht so richtig mit. Mittlerweile l√§ufts aber wieder besser und deshalb haben wir Colins Bruder Oliver G√§bel, hauptberuflich Pilot, wieder ans Steuer gesetzt und ihn ein paar Runden drehen lassen.

- Your game is very simple.
Your token said, hope you can catch,
which is precisely what this next game is.
We are going to start dropping
red balls like this one.
If you'll look up,
you'll notice there
are holes in your roof.
You have to catch the ball and
not let it touch the ground.
And if at any point
a red ball touches
(ball smashes)
the ground on your side,
your tower will turn red
and your entire team will be eliminated.
- [Contestant] Wow.
- We're gonna drop balls
until that happens.
It's literally that simple.
Five million dollars on the line.
I'll give you some time to prep.
- Huddle up.
- Huddle up.
- Huddle up, guys, come on.
- Huddle up, huddle up.
- [Contestant] Let's
go, let's go, let's go.
- I got a strategy.
- All right, what's yours.
- What do we think about tall
and short pairing up together?
- [Contestant] I don't
think that's a good idea.
- No.
- No.
- If you're confident
at catching, go here.
If you're a holder, go here.
- I can catch.
- Holder.
- Can you pick a grid or
something to focus on?
- I want this area right here.
- Yes, I'm catching, she's holding.
- [Contestant] Get a quadrant.
- Like to just suggest,
once you can't hold onto any more balls,
you should move to this side.
- Strongest catchers.
- I want balls.
- We need a few catchers right here.
- Everybody stay cool.
Keep your eyes up.
We got this, we got this.
(contestants applauding)
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.
(contestants cheering)
- [Contestant] Everybody stay calm.
- Three,
(dramatic drum music)
two,
one,
go!
(ball whooshes)
(ball clatters)
Oh, oh, ho, ho.
All right, they both got one.
(contestants cheering)
(balls whooshing)
(ball clatters)
That's it.
(contestants clamoring)
Okay, they both got two.
(screen change whooshes)
(balls whooshing)
- Coming down, coming down.
- Oh, my God.
- I got em.
- Catch it.
- All right.
- Oh, my gosh, oh, my God.
- They both got three.
- Ball, ball, ball.
- Things are heating up.
(ball whooshes)
- Get it, get it, get it, get it.
- [Contestant] Watch,
watch, watch your area,
watch your area.
(ball whooshes)
(contestants clamoring)
- [Contestant] That
way, that way, that way.
- Ball, ball, ball.
- Here.
(ball thuds)
(contestant moaning)
(tower lights clunking and buzzing)
(contestants cheering and screaming)
- That was so fast.
They dropped the ball,
literally and figuratively.
(dramatic orchestral music)
- [Contestant] Breathe, oh,
breathe, it's okay, it's okay.
- Man, I'm going home with nothing.
(dramatic orchestral music continues)
- [Mr. Beast] We can take
'em out of the towers.
- [Organizer] Maybe not, the
control room caught something
that one of the guards missed.
- [Mr. Beast] Oh, my God.
(contestants cheering)
- The thing that is curious to me
is why are you even still here?
(contestants applauding and cheering)
- Can I talk to you over here?
The first one came down and I
bobbled it and I dropped it.
(contestants arguing indistinctly)
- Don't worry, don't worry.
- I don't know what happened.
- I don't care, bro.
- No, I'm not.
- Serious, stop, stop, stop.
- Stop talking.
- I'm not gonna pretend,
'cause they have cameras.
- I'm gonna put you on time out.
Like, you just gotta stop talking because-
- You're a kid.
- Dude, I know, but the
more you keep spreading it,
the more you're putting it in the world.
- Dude, it's on camera, bro.
- I don't care, dude.
- Okay.
- Just sit down and be quiet.
- [Contestant] I'm just
trying to set expectations.
- And I know you're being
honest, I just... (indistinct)
- Be quiet.
- Yeah, okay.
- Quiet, that's it.
- All right, can you hear me?
We're gonna show some footage
because I think you guys
would find it interesting.
Show when yellow team dropped the ball.
Okay, that was yellow team's fourth ball.
- That's just like, ugh.
- Now, can you throw up the white team.
(suspenseful orchestral music)
(contestants gasping and groaning)
That was white team's first ball.
(yellow team contestants cheering)
Yes, which means the
decision has been reversed.
Turn their tower red.
We did not catch it in the moment
because the guards did
not have a line of sight.
But every decision made during this show
is reviewed afterwards
and when reviewing it,
we saw the correct call.
(yellow team contestants
cheering and screaming)
- We are all confidants
for the rest of this game.
Anyone on this platform
is now part of our team.
(yellow team contestants cheering)
(upbeat music)",""

Auf Steam gibt es inzwischen √ºber 120.000 Spiele und allein 2024 sind fast 18.000 davon erschienen. Eine unglaubliche Menge. Zur Veranschaulichung: W√ºrdet ihr eine physische Ausgabe von jedem Steam-Spiel besitzen, k√∂nntet ihr sie zu einem 1.800 Meter hohen Turm aufstapeln.

Doch welche der Spiele aus dem vergangenen Jahr sind die unbestritten besten, wenn es nach uns Spielerinnen und Spielern geht? Wir stellen euch die 20 von den Kunden am besten bewerteten Titel auf Steam vor.

Als Grundlage f√ºr unsere Liste dient der Algorithmus der Website Steam 250, der den Anteil positiver Bewertungen mit deren Anzahl der Reviews verrechnet. Spiele mit extrem guten, aber nur sehr wenigen Steam-Reviews werden so besser aussortiert. Ein Spiel mit 10.000 Bewertungen, die zu 90 Prozent positiv sind, landet also vor einem Spiel mit 100 Bewertungen, die zu 100 Prozent positiv sind. Die Ergebnisse dieser Berechnungen fallen durchaus etwas √ºberraschend aus: Es landen n√§mlich viele Spiele in den Top 20, von denen der eine oder andere vielleicht noch nie geh√∂rt hat.

Doch welche der Spiele aus dem vergangenen Jahr sind die unbestritten besten, wenn es nach uns Spielerinnen und Spielern geht? Wir stellen euch die 20 von den Kunden am besten bewerteten Titel auf Steam vor.

Als Grundlage f√ºr unsere Liste dient der Algorithmus der Website Steam 250, der den Anteil positiver Bewertungen mit deren Anzahl der Reviews verrechnet. Spiele mit extrem guten, aber nur sehr wenigen Steam-Reviews werden so besser aussortiert. Ein Spiel mit 10.000 Bewertungen, die zu 90 Prozent positiv sind, landet also vor einem Spiel mit 100 Bewertungen, die zu 100 Prozent positiv sind. Die Ergebnisse dieser Berechnungen fallen durchaus etwas √ºberraschend aus: Es landen n√§mlich viele Spiele in den Top 20, von denen der eine oder andere vielleicht noch nie geh√∂rt hat.

Lord of the Rings Warhammer, or the Middle Earth strategy battle game just got a brand new edition and a brand new box set of shiny miniatures, And I mean shiny, for the first time in over a decade we are talking brand new plastic warriors for Middle Earth. This is just so long overdue. The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game basically built Games Workshop as we know it, it would be a shadow of the company it is today without our beloved game, the huge cash injection that Middle Earth brought to GW in the early 2000‚Äôs paid for all the early investment in glorious plastic technologies that we gave become so accustomed to. Games Workshop‚Äôs launch of the new edition of the Middle Earth Strategy battle game has been kicked off with this glorious Battle of Edoras box, jammed pack with brand new plastic warriors, and I honestly just can‚Äôt believe it.
